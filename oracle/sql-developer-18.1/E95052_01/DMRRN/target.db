Oracle Data Miner 18.1 Release NotesNew Features in Oracle Data Miner New Features in Oracle Data MinerMoitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Oracle Data Mining FeaturesOracle Data Mining FeaturesMoitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Association Model Aggregation MetricsAssociation Model Aggregation MetricsOracle Data Miner supports the enhanced Association Rules algorithm and allows the user to filter items before building the Association model.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancements to Algorithm SettingsEnhancements to Algorithm SettingsOracle Data Miner has been enhanced to support enhancements in Oracle Data Mining that includes build settings for building partition models, sampling of training data, numeric data preparation that includes shift and scale transformations, and so on.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Changes to Decision Tree Algorithm SettingsChanges to Decision Tree Algorithm SettingsThe setting Maximum Supervised Bins CLAS_MAX_SUP_BINS is added in the Decision Tree algorithm.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Changes to Expectation Maximization Algorithm SettingsChanges to Expectation Maximization Algorithm SettingsThe setting Level of Detailsreplaces the current setting Gather Cluster Statistics. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Changes to Generalized Linear Models Algorithm SettingsChanges to Generalized Linear Models Algorithm SettingsThe following changes are included in the Generalized Linear Model algorithm settings. The changes apply to both Classification models and Regression models.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Changes to k-Means Algorithm SettingsChanges to k-Means Algorithm SettingsThe following changes are incorporated to the k-Means algorithm settings.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Changes to Support Vector Machine Algorithm SettingsChanges to Support Vector Machine Algorithm SettingsThe following changes are included in the Support Vector Machine algorithm settings. The changes are applicable to both Linear and Gaussian kernel functions.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Changes to Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Components Analysis Algorithm SettingsChanges to Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Components Analysis Algorithm SettingsThe following changes are included in the Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Components Analysis algorithm. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Support for Explicit Semantic Analysis AlgorithmSupport for Explicit Semantic Analysis AlgorithmOracle Data Miner 18.1 supports a new feature extraction algorithm called Explicit Semantic Analysis algorithm.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Explicit Feature Extraction NodeExplicit Feature Extraction NodeThe Explicit Feature Extraction node is built using the Explicit Semantic Analysis algorithm. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Feature Compare NodeFeature Compare NodeThe Feature Compare node enables you to perform calculations related to semantics in text data, contained in one Data Source node against another Data Source node.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancement to Data Mining Model Detail ViewEnhancement to Data Mining Model Detail ViewThe model viewers in Oracle Data Miner have been enhanced to reflect the changes in Oracle Data Mining.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancements to Filter Column NodeEnhancements to Filter Column NodeOracle Data mining supports unsupervised Attribute Importance ranking. The Attribute Importance ranking of a column is generated without the need for selecting a target column. The Filter Column node has been enhanced to support unsupervised Attribute Importance ranking. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Mining Model Build AlertsMining Model Build AlertsOracle Data Miner logs alerts related to model builds in the model viewers and event logs.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018R Build Model NodeR Build Model NodeOracle Data Mining provides the feature to add R model implementations within the Oracle Data Mining framework. To support R model integration, Oracle Data Miner has been enhanced with a new R Build node with mining functions such as Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Feature Extraction. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Support for Partitioned ModelsSupport for Partitioned ModelsOracle Data Miner supports the building and testing of partitioned models. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Oracle Data Miner FeaturesOracle Data Miner FeaturesMoitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Aggregation Node Support for DATE and TIMESTAMP Data TypesAggregation Node Support for DATE and TIMESTAMP Data TypesThe Aggregation node has been enhanced to support DATE and TIMESTAMP data types.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancement to JSON Query NodeEnhancement to JSON Query NodeThe JSON Query node allows to specify filter conditions on attributes with data types such as ARRAY, BOOLEAN, NUMBER and STRING. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancement to Build NodesEnhancement to Build NodesAll Build nodes are enhanced to support sampling of training data and preparation of numeric data. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancement to Text SettingsEnhancement to Text SettingsText settings are enhanced to support the following features:Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Refresh Input Data DefinitionRefresh Input Data DefinitionUse the Refresh Input Data Definition option if you want to update the workflow with new columns, that are either added or removed.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Support for Additional Data TypesSupport for Additional Data TypesOracle Data Miner allows the following data types for input as columns in a Data Source node, and as new computed columns within the workflow:Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Support for In-Memory ColumnSupport for In-Memory ColumnOracle Data Miner supports In-Memory Column Store (IM Column Store) in Oracle Database 12.2 and later, which is an optional static SGA pool that stores copies of tables and partitions in a special columnar format. Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Support for Workflow SchedulingSupport for Workflow SchedulingOracle Data Miner supports the feature to schedule workflows to run at a definite date and time.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Enhancement to Polling PerformanceEnhancement to Polling PerformancePolling performance and resource utilization functionality has been enhanced with new user interfaces.Moitreyee HazarikaMark KellyMarch2018Workflow Status Polling Performance ImprovementWorkflow Status Polling Performance ImprovementThe performance of workflow status polling has been enhanced.
