<p>By now, you’ve learned most of the day-to-day commands and workflows that you need to manage or maintain a Git repository for your source code control.
You’ve accomplished the basic tasks of tracking and committing files, and you’ve harnessed the power of the staging area and lightweight topic branching and merging.</p>
<p>Now you’ll explore a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some point.</p>
<section class="sect1" title="Revision Selection">
<h2 id="r_revision_selection">Revision Selection</h2>
<p>Git allows you to specify specific commits or a range of commits in several ways.
They aren’t necessarily obvious but are helpful to know.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Single Revisions">
<h3 id="_single_revisions">Single Revisions</h3>
<p>You can obviously refer to a commit by the SHA-1 hash that it’s given, but there are more human-friendly ways to refer to commits as well.
This section outlines the various ways you can refer to a single commit.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Short SHA-1">
<h3 id="_short_sha_1">Short SHA-1</h3>
<p>Git is smart enough to figure out what commit you meant to type if you provide the first few characters, as long as your partial SHA-1 is at least four characters long and unambiguous – that is, only one object in the current repository begins with that partial SHA-1.</p>
<p>For example, to see a specific commit, suppose you run a <code class="literal">git log</code> command and identify the commit where you added certain functionality:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log
commit 734713bc047d87bf7eac9674765ae793478c50d3

    fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated tests

commit d921970aadf03b3cf0e71becdaab3147ba71cdef
Merge: 1c002dd... 35cfb2b...
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Dec 11 15:08:43 2008 -0800

    Merge commit &#39;phedders/rdocs&#39;

commit 1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b

Date:   Thu Dec 11 14:58:32 2008 -0800

    added some blame and merge stuff</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>In this case, choose <code class="literal">1c002dd...</code>. If you <code class="literal">git show</code> that commit, the following commands are equivalent (assuming the shorter versions are unambiguous):</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show 1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show 1c002dd4b536e7479f
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show 1c002d</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Git can figure out a short, unique abbreviation for your SHA-1 values.
If you pass <code class="literal">--abbrev-commit</code> to the <code class="literal">git log</code> command, the output will use shorter values but keep them unique; it defaults to using seven characters but makes them longer if necessary to keep the SHA-1 unambiguous:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
ca82a6d changed the version number
085bb3b removed unnecessary test code
a11bef0 first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique within a project.</p>
<p>As an example, the Linux kernel, which is a pretty large project with over 450k commits and 3.6 million objects, has no two objects whose SHA-1s overlap more than the first 11 characters.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="筆記: A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1" epub:type="note">
<h2>A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>A lot of people become concerned at some point that they will, by random happenstance, have two objects in their repository that hash to the same SHA-1 value.
What then?</p>
<p>If you do happen to commit an object that hashes to the same SHA-1 value as a previous object in your repository, Git will see the previous object already in your Git database and assume it was already written.
If you try to check out that object again at some point, you’ll always get the data of the first object.</p>
<p>However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this scenario is.
The SHA-1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits.
The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about 2<sup>80</sup>
(the formula for determining collision probability is <code class="literal">p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160))</code>. 2<sup>80</sup>
is 1.2 x 10<sup>24</sup>
or 1 million billion billion.
That’s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.</p>
<p>Here’s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a SHA-1 collision.
If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming, and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent of the entire Linux kernel history (3.6 million Git objects) and pushing it into one enormous Git repository, it would take roughly 2 years until that repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a single SHA-1 object collision.
A higher probability exists that every member of your programming team will be attacked and killed by wolves in unrelated incidents on the same night.</p>
</div>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Branch References">
<h3 id="r_branch_references">Branch References</h3>
<p>The most straightforward way to specify a commit requires that it has a branch reference pointed at it.
Then, you can use a branch name in any Git command that expects a commit object or SHA-1 value.
For instance, if you want to show the last commit object on a branch, the following commands are equivalent, assuming that the <code class="literal">topic1</code> branch points to <code class="literal">ca82a6d</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show topic1</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you want to see which specific SHA-1 a branch points to, or if you want to see what any of these examples boils down to in terms of SHA-1s, you can use a Git plumbing tool called <code class="literal">rev-parse</code>.
You can see <a id="xref--ch10-git-internals" href="ch10-git-internals.xhtml" class="xref">Git Internals</a> for more information about plumbing tools; basically, <code class="literal">rev-parse</code> exists for lower-level operations and isn’t designed to be used in day-to-day operations.
However, it can be helpful sometimes when you need to see what’s really going on.
Here you can run <code class="literal">rev-parse</code> on your branch.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rev-parse topic1
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949</code></pre>
</figure>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="RefLog Shortnames">
<h3 id="r_git_reflog">RefLog Shortnames</h3>
<p>One of the things Git does in the background while you’re working away is keep a “reflog” – a log of where your HEAD and branch references have been for the last few months.</p>
<p>You can see your reflog by using <code class="literal">git reflog</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git reflog
734713b HEAD@{0}: commit: fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated
d921970 HEAD@{1}: merge phedders/rdocs: Merge made by recursive.
1c002dd HEAD@{2}: commit: added some blame and merge stuff
1c36188 HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
95df984 HEAD@{4}: commit: # This is a combination of two commits.
1c36188 HEAD@{5}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
7e05da5 HEAD@{6}: rebase -i (pick): updating HEAD</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Every time your branch tip is updated for any reason, Git stores that information for you in this temporary history.
And you can specify older commits with this data, as well.
If you want to see the fifth prior value of the HEAD of your repository, you can use the <code class="literal">@{n}</code> reference that you see in the reflog output:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show HEAD@{5}</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can also use this syntax to see where a branch was some specific amount of time ago.
For instance, to see where your <code class="literal">master</code> branch was yesterday, you can type</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show master@{yesterday}</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>That shows you where the branch tip was yesterday.
This technique only works for data that’s still in your reflog, so you can’t use it to look for commits older than a few months.</p>
<p>To see reflog information formatted like the <code class="literal">git log</code> output, you can run <code class="literal">git log -g</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log -g master
commit 734713bc047d87bf7eac9674765ae793478c50d3

Reflog message: commit: fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;

    fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated tests

commit d921970aadf03b3cf0e71becdaab3147ba71cdef
Reflog: master@{1} (Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;)
Reflog message: merge phedders/rdocs: Merge made by recursive.
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Dec 11 15:08:43 2008 -0800

    Merge commit &#39;phedders/rdocs&#39;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>It’s important to note that the reflog information is strictly local – it’s a log of what you’ve done in your repository.
The references won’t be the same on someone else’s copy of the repository; and right after you initially clone a repository, you&#8217;ll have an empty reflog, as no activity has occurred yet in your repository.
Running <code class="literal">git show HEAD@{2.months.ago}</code> will work only if you cloned the project at least two months ago – if you cloned it five minutes ago, you’ll get no results.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Ancestry References">
<h3 id="_ancestry_references">Ancestry References</h3>
<p>The other main way to specify a commit is via its ancestry.
If you place a <code class="literal">^</code> at the end of a reference, Git resolves it to mean the parent of that commit.
Suppose you look at the history of your project:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --pretty=format:<span style="font-style: italic">&#39;%h %s&#39;</span> --graph
* 734713b fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated tests
*   d921970 Merge commit &#39;phedders/rdocs&#39;
|\
| * 35cfb2b Some rdoc changes
* | 1c002dd added some blame and merge stuff
|/
* 1c36188 ignore *.gem
* 9b29157 add open3_detach to gemspec file list</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Then, you can see the previous commit by specifying <code class="literal">HEAD^</code>, which means “the parent of HEAD”:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show HEAD^
commit d921970aadf03b3cf0e71becdaab3147ba71cdef
Merge: 1c002dd... 35cfb2b...
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Dec 11 15:08:43 2008 -0800

    Merge commit &#39;phedders/rdocs&#39;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can also specify a number after the <code class="literal">^</code> – for example, <code class="literal">d921970^2</code> means “the second parent of d921970.”
This syntax is only useful for merge commits, which have more than one parent.
The first parent is the branch you were on when you merged, and the second is the commit on the branch that you merged in:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show d921970^
commit 1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Dec 11 14:58:32 2008 -0800

    added some blame and merge stuff

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show d921970^2
commit 35cfb2b795a55793d7cc56a6cc2060b4bb732548
Author: Paul Hedderly &lt;paul+git@mjr.org&gt;
Date:   Wed Dec 10 22:22:03 2008 +0000

    Some rdoc changes</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The other main ancestry specification is the <code class="literal">~</code>.
This also refers to the first parent, so <code class="literal">HEAD~</code> and <code class="literal">HEAD^</code> are equivalent.
The difference becomes apparent when you specify a number.
<code class="literal">HEAD~2</code> means “the first parent of the first parent,” or “the grandparent” – it traverses the first parents the number of times you specify.
For example, in the history listed earlier, <code class="literal">HEAD~3</code> would be</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show HEAD~3
commit 1c3618887afb5fbcbea25b7c013f4e2114448b8d
Author: Tom Preston-Werner &lt;tom@mojombo.com&gt;
Date:   Fri Nov 7 13:47:59 2008 -0500

    ignore *.gem</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This can also be written <code class="literal">HEAD^^^</code>, which again is the first parent of the first parent of the first parent:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show HEAD^^^
commit 1c3618887afb5fbcbea25b7c013f4e2114448b8d
Author: Tom Preston-Werner &lt;tom@mojombo.com&gt;
Date:   Fri Nov 7 13:47:59 2008 -0500

    ignore *.gem</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can also combine these syntaxes – you can get the second parent of the previous reference (assuming it was a merge commit) by using <code class="literal">HEAD~3^2</code>, and so on.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Commit Ranges">
<h3 id="r_commit_ranges">Commit Ranges</h3>
<p>Now that you can specify individual commits, let’s see how to specify ranges of commits.
This is particularly useful for managing your branches – if you have a lot of branches, you can use range specifications to answer questions such as, “What work is on this branch that I haven’t yet merged into my main branch?”</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Double Dot">
<h4 id="_double_dot">Double Dot</h4>
<p>The most common range specification is the double-dot syntax.
This basically asks Git to resolve a range of commits that are reachable from one commit but aren’t reachable from another.
For example, say you have a commit history that looks like <a id="xref-rdouble_dot" href="#rdouble_dot" class="xref">Example history for range selection.</a>.</p>
<figure id="rdouble_dot" class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/double-dot.png" alt="Example history for range selection."/>
</div>
<figcaption>圖表 1. Example history for range selection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You want to see what is in your experiment branch that hasn’t yet been merged into your master branch.
You can ask Git to show you a log of just those commits with <code class="literal">master..experiment</code> – that means “all commits reachable by experiment that aren’t reachable by master.”
For the sake of brevity and clarity in these examples, I’ll use the letters of the commit objects from the diagram in place of the actual log output in the order that they would display:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log master..experiment
D
C</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to see the opposite – all commits in <code class="literal">master</code> that aren’t in <code class="literal">experiment</code> – you can reverse the branch names.
<code class="literal">experiment..master</code> shows you everything in <code class="literal">master</code> not reachable from <code class="literal">experiment</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log experiment..master
F
E</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This is useful if you want to keep the <code class="literal">experiment</code> branch up to date and preview what you’re about to merge in.
Another very frequent use of this syntax is to see what you’re about to push to a remote:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log origin/master..HEAD</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command shows you any commits in your current branch that aren’t in the <code class="literal">master</code> branch on your <code class="literal">origin</code> remote.
If you run a <code class="literal">git push</code> and your current branch is tracking <code class="literal">origin/master</code>, the commits listed by <code class="literal">git log origin/master..HEAD</code> are the commits that will be transferred to the server.
You can also leave off one side of the syntax to have Git assume HEAD.
For example, you can get the same results as in the previous example by typing <code class="literal">git log origin/master..</code> – Git substitutes HEAD if one side is missing.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Multiple Points">
<h4 id="_multiple_points">Multiple Points</h4>
<p>The double-dot syntax is useful as a shorthand; but perhaps you want to specify more than two branches to indicate your revision, such as seeing what commits are in any of several branches that aren’t in the branch you’re currently on.
Git allows you to do this by using either the <code class="literal">^</code> character or <code class="literal">--not</code> before any reference from which you don’t want to see reachable commits.
Thus these three commands are equivalent:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log refA..refB
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log ^refA refB
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log refB --not refA</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This is nice because with this syntax you can specify more than two references in your query, which you cannot do with the double-dot syntax.
For instance, if you want to see all commits that are reachable from <code class="literal">refA</code> or <code class="literal">refB</code> but not from <code class="literal">refC</code>, you can type one of these:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log refA refB ^refC
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log refA refB --not refC</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This makes for a very powerful revision query system that should help you figure out what is in your branches.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Triple Dot">
<h4 id="r_triple_dot">Triple Dot</h4>
<p>The last major range-selection syntax is the triple-dot syntax, which specifies all the commits that are reachable by either of two references but not by both of them.
Look back at the example commit history in <a href="#rdouble_dot" class="xref">Example history for range selection.</a>.
If you want to see what is in <code class="literal">master</code> or <code class="literal">experiment</code> but not any common references, you can run</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log master...experiment
F
E
D
C</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Again, this gives you normal <code class="literal">log</code> output but shows you only the commit information for those four commits, appearing in the traditional commit date ordering.</p>
<p>A common switch to use with the <code class="literal">log</code> command in this case is <code class="literal">--left-right</code>, which shows you which side of the range each commit is in.
This helps make the data more useful:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --left-right master...experiment
&lt; F
&lt; E
<span style="font-weight: bold">&gt;</span> D
<span style="font-weight: bold">&gt;</span> C</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>With these tools, you can much more easily let Git know what commit or commits you want to inspect.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Interactive Staging">
<h2 id="r_interactive_staging">Interactive Staging</h2>
<p>Git comes with a couple of scripts that make some command-line tasks easier.
Here, you’ll look at a few interactive commands that can help you easily craft your commits to include only certain combinations and parts of files.
These tools are very helpful if you modify a bunch of files and then decide that you want those changes to be in several focused commits rather than one big messy commit.
This way, you can make sure your commits are logically separate changesets and can be easily reviewed by the developers working with you.
If you run <code class="literal">git add</code> with the <code class="literal">-i</code> or <code class="literal">--interactive</code> option, Git goes into an interactive shell mode, displaying something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add -i
           staged     unstaged path
  1:    unchanged        +0/-1 TODO
  2:    unchanged        +1/-1 index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb

*** Commands ***
  1: status     2: update      3: revert     4: add untracked
  5: patch      6: diff        7: quit       8: help
What now&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that this command shows you a much different view of your staging area – basically the same information you get with <code class="literal">git status</code> but a bit more succinct and informative.
It lists the changes you’ve staged on the left and unstaged changes on the right.</p>
<p>After this comes a Commands section.
Here you can do a number of things, including staging files, unstaging files, staging parts of files, adding untracked files, and seeing diffs of what has been staged.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Staging and Unstaging Files">
<h3 id="_staging_and_unstaging_files">Staging and Unstaging Files</h3>
<p>If you type <code class="literal">2</code> or <code class="literal">u</code> at the <code class="literal">What now&gt;</code> prompt, the script prompts you for which files you want to stage:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>What now&gt; 2
           staged     unstaged path
  1:    unchanged        +0/-1 TODO
  2:    unchanged        +1/-1 index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Update&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>To stage the TODO and index.html files, you can type the numbers:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>Update&gt;&gt; 1,2
           staged     unstaged path
* 1:    unchanged        +0/-1 TODO
* 2:    unchanged        +1/-1 index.html
  3:    unchanged        +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Update&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">*</code> next to each file means the file is selected to be staged.
If you press Enter after typing nothing at the <code class="literal">Update&gt;&gt;</code> prompt, Git takes anything selected and stages it for you:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>Update&gt;&gt;

*** Commands ***
  1: status     2: update      3: revert     4: add untracked

<h3 id="_staging_patches">Staging Patches</h3>
<p>It’s also possible for Git to stage certain parts of files and not the rest.
For example, if you make two changes to your simplegit.rb file and want to stage one of them and not the other, doing so is very easy in Git.
From the interactive prompt, type <code class="literal">5</code> or <code class="literal">p</code> (for patch).
Git will ask you which files you would like to partially stage; then, for each section of the selected files, it will display hunks of the file diff and ask if you would like to stage them, one by one:</p>

</figure>
<p>Generally, you’ll type <code class="literal">y</code> or <code class="literal">n</code> if you want to stage each hunk, but staging all of them in certain files or skipping a hunk decision until later can be helpful too.
If you stage one part of the file and leave another part unstaged, your status output will look like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">

</figure>
<p>The status of the simplegit.rb file is interesting.
It shows you that a couple of lines are staged and a couple are unstaged.
You’ve partially staged this file.
At this point, you can exit the interactive adding script and run <code class="literal">git commit</code> to commit the partially staged files.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to be in interactive add mode to do the partial-file staging – you can start the same script by using <code class="literal">git add -p</code> or <code class="literal">git add --patch</code> on the command line.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can use patch mode for partially resetting files with the <code class="literal">reset --patch</code> command, for checking out parts of files with the <code class="literal">checkout --patch</code> command and for stashing parts of files with the <code class="literal">stash save --patch</code> command.
We&#8217;ll go into more details on each of these as we get to more advanced usages of these commands.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Stashing and Cleaning">
<h2 id="r_git_stashing">Stashing and Cleaning</h2>
<p>Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else.
The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later.
The answer to this issue is the <code class="literal">git stash</code> command.</p>
<p>Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory – that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes – and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Stashing Your Work">
<h3 id="_stashing_your_work">Stashing Your Work</h3>
<p>To demonstrate, you’ll go into your project and start working on a couple of files and possibly stage one of the changes.
If you run <code class="literal">git status</code>, you can see your dirty state:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

	modified:   index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now you want to switch branches, but you don’t want to commit what you’ve been working on yet; so you’ll stash the changes.
To push a new stash onto your stack, run <code class="literal">git stash</code> or <code class="literal">git stash save</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git stash
Saved working directory and index state \
  &quot;WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file&quot;
HEAD is now at 049d078 added the index file
(To restore them type &quot;git stash apply&quot;)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Your working directory is clean:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>At this point, you can easily switch branches and do work elsewhere; your changes are stored on your stack.
To see which stashes you’ve stored, you can use <code class="literal">git stash list</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert &quot;added file_size&quot;
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>In this case, two stashes were done previously, so you have access to three different stashed works.
You can reapply the one you just stashed by using the command shown in the help output of the original stash command: <code class="literal">git stash apply</code>.
If you want to apply one of the older stashes, you can specify it by naming it, like this: <code class="literal">git stash apply stash@{2}</code>.
If you don’t specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash and tries to apply it:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git stash apply
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html
	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that Git re-modifies the files you reverted when you saved the stash.
In this case, you had a clean working directory when you tried to apply the stash, and you tried to apply it on the same branch you saved it from; but having a clean working directory and applying it on the same branch aren’t necessary to successfully apply a stash.
You can save a stash on one branch, switch to another branch later, and try to reapply the changes.
You can also have modified and uncommitted files in your working directory when you apply a stash – Git gives you merge conflicts if anything no longer applies cleanly.</p>
<p>The changes to your files were reapplied, but the file you staged before wasn’t restaged.
To do that, you must run the <code class="literal">git stash apply</code> command with a <code class="literal">--index</code> option to tell the command to try to reapply the staged changes.
If you had run that instead, you’d have gotten back to your original position:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git stash apply --index
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

	modified:   index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lib/simplegit.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The apply option only tries to apply the stashed work – you continue to have it on your stack.
To remove it, you can run <code class="literal">git stash drop</code> with the name of the stash to remove:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git stash list

</figure>
<p>You can also run <code class="literal">git stash pop</code> to apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Creative Stashing">
<h3 id="_creative_stashing">Creative Stashing</h3>
<p>There are a few stash variants that may also be helpful.
The first option that is quite popular is the <code class="literal">--keep-index</code> option to the <code class="literal">stash save</code> command.
This tells Git to not stash anything that you&#8217;ve already staged with the <code class="literal">git add</code> command.</p>
<p>This can be really helpful if you&#8217;ve made a number of changes but want to only commit some of them and then come back to the rest of the changes at a later time.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status -s

</figure>
<p>Another common thing you may want to do with stash is to stash the untracked files as well as the tracked ones.
By default, <code class="literal">git stash</code> will only store files that are already in the index.
If you specify <code class="literal">--include-untracked</code> or <code class="literal">-u</code>, Git will also stash any untracked files you have created.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status -s

</figure>
<p>Finally, if you specify the <code class="literal">--patch</code> flag, Git will not stash everything that is modified but will instead prompt you interactively which of the changes you would like to stash and which you would like to keep in your working directory.</p>
<figure class="listing">

<h3 id="_creating_a_branch_from_a_stash">Creating a Branch from a Stash</h3>
<p>If you stash some work, leave it there for a while, and continue on the branch from which you stashed the work, you may have a problem reapplying the work.
If the apply tries to modify a file that you’ve since modified, you’ll get a merge conflict and will have to try to resolve it.
If you want an easier way to test the stashed changes again, you can run <code class="literal">git stash branch</code>, which creates a new branch for you, checks out the commit you were on when you stashed your work, reapplies your work there, and then drops the stash if it applies successfully:</p>

<section class="sect2" title="Cleaning your Working Directory">
<h3 id="r_git_clean">Cleaning your Working Directory</h3>
<p>Finally, you may not want to stash some work or files in your working directory, but simply get rid of them.
The <code class="literal">git clean</code> command will do this for you.</p>
<p>Some common reasons for this might be to remove cruft that has been generated by merges or external tools or to remove build artifacts in order to run a clean build.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to be pretty careful with this command, since it&#8217;s designed to remove files from your working directory that are not tracked.
If you change your mind, there is often no retrieving the content of those files.
A safer option is to run <code class="literal">git stash --all</code> to remove everything but save it in a stash.</p>
<p>Assuming you do want to remove cruft files or clean your working directory, you can do so with <code class="literal">git clean</code>.
To remove all the untracked files in your working directory, you can run <code class="literal">git clean -f -d</code>, which removes any files and also any subdirectories that become empty as a result.
The <code class="literal">-f</code> means <em>force</em> or "really do this".</p>
<p>If you ever want to see what it would do, you can run the command with the <code class="literal">-n</code> option, which means “do a dry run and tell me what you <em>would</em> have removed”.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clean -d -n
Would remove test.o
Would remove tmp/</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>By default, the <code class="literal">git clean</code> command will only remove untracked files that are not ignored.
Any file that matches a pattern in your <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> or other ignore files will not be removed.
If you want to remove those files too, such as to remove all <code class="literal">.o</code> files generated from a build so you can do a fully clean build, you can add a <code class="literal">-x</code> to the clean command.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status -s
 M lib/simplegit.rb
?? build.TMP
?? tmp/

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clean -n -d
Would remove build.TMP
Would remove tmp/

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clean -n -d -x
Would remove build.TMP
Would remove test.o
Would remove tmp/</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what the <code class="literal">git clean</code> command is going to do, always run it with a <code class="literal">-n</code> first to double check before changing the <code class="literal">-n</code> to a <code class="literal">-f</code> and doing it for real.
The other way you can be careful about the process is to run it with the <code class="literal">-i</code> or “interactive” flag.</p>
<p>This will run the clean command in an interactive mode.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clean -x -i
Would remove the following items:

<section class="sect1" title="Signing Your Work">
<h2 id="r_signing">Signing Your Work</h2>
<p>Git is cryptographically secure, but it&#8217;s not foolproof.
If you&#8217;re taking work from others on the internet and want to verify that commits are actually from a trusted source, Git has a few ways to sign and verify work using GPG.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="GPG Introduction">
<h3 id="_gpg_introduction">GPG Introduction</h3>
<p>First of all, if you want to sign anything you need to get GPG configured and your personal key installed.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> gpg --list-keys

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a key installed, you can generate one with <code class="literal">gpg --gen-key</code>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>gpg --gen-key</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Once you have a private key to sign with, you can configure Git to use it for signing things by setting the <code class="literal">user.signingkey</code> config setting.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>git config --global user.signingkey 0A46826A</code></pre>

<p>If you have a GPG private key setup, you can now use it to sign new tags.

<h3 id="_everyone_must_sign">Everyone Must Sign</h3>
<p>Signing tags and commits is great, but if you decide to use this in your normal workflow, you&#8217;ll have to make sure that everyone on your team understands how to do so.
If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll end up spending a lot of time helping people figure out how to rewrite their commits with signed versions.
Make sure you understand GPG and the benefits of signing things before adopting this as part of your standard workflow.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Searching">
<h2 id="r_searching">Searching</h2>
<p>With just about any size codebase, you&#8217;ll often need to find where a function is called or defined, or find the history of a method.
Git provides a couple of useful tools for looking through the code and commits stored in its database quickly and easily.
We&#8217;ll go through a few of them.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Git Grep">
<h3 id="r_git_grep">Git Grep</h3>
<p>Git ships with a command called <code class="literal">grep</code> that allows you to easily search through any committed tree or the working directory for a string or regular expression.
For these examples, we&#8217;ll look through the Git source code itself.</p>
<p>By default, it will look through the files in your working directory.
You can pass <code class="literal">-n</code> to print out the line numbers where Git has found matches.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git grep -n gmtime_r
<span style="font-weight: bold">compat/gmtime.c:3:#</span>undef gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:8:      return git_gmtime_r(timep, &amp;result);
compat/gmtime.c:11:struct tm *git_gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result)
compat/gmtime.c:16:     ret = gmtime_r(timep, result);
compat/mingw.c:606:struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result)
compat/mingw.h:162:struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);
date.c:429:             if (gmtime_r(&amp;now, &amp;now_tm))
date.c:492:             if (gmtime_r(&amp;time, tm)) {
git-compat-util.h:721:struct tm *git_gmtime_r(const time_t *, struct tm *);
<span style="font-weight: bold">git-compat-util.h:723:#</span>define gmtime_r git_gmtime_r</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>There are a number of interesting options you can provide the <code class="literal">grep</code> command.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of the previous call, you can have Git summarize the output by just showing you which files matched and how many matches there were in each file with the <code class="literal">--count</code> option:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git grep --count gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:4
compat/mingw.c:1
compat/mingw.h:1
date.c:2
git-compat-util.h:2</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you want to see what method or function it thinks it has found a match in, you can pass <code class="literal">-p</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git grep -p gmtime_r *.c
date.c=static int match_multi_number(unsigned long num, char c, const char *date, char *end, struct tm *tm)
date.c:         if (gmtime_r(&amp;now, &amp;now_tm))
date.c=static int match_digit(const char *date, struct tm *tm, int *offset, int *tm_gmt)
date.c:         if (gmtime_r(&amp;time, tm)) {</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>So here we can see that <code class="literal">gmtime_r</code> is called in the <code class="literal">match_multi_number</code> and <code class="literal">match_digit</code> functions in the date.c file.</p>
<p>You can also look for complex combinations of strings with the <code class="literal">--and</code> flag, which makes sure that multiple matches are in the same line.
For instance, let&#8217;s look for any lines that define a constant with either the strings “LINK” or “BUF_MAX” in them in the Git codebase in an older 1.8.0 version.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ll also use the <code class="literal">--break</code> and <code class="literal">--heading</code> options which help split up the output into a more readable format.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git grep --break --heading <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">\</span>

</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">git grep</code> command has a few advantages over normal searching commands like <code class="literal">grep</code> and <code class="literal">ack</code>.
The first is that it&#8217;s really fast, the second is that you can search through any tree in Git, not just the working directory.
As we saw in the above example, we looked for terms in an older version of the Git source code, not the version that was currently checked out.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Git Log Searching">
<h3 id="_git_log_searching">Git Log Searching</h3>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re looking not for <strong>where</strong> a term exists, but <strong>when</strong> it existed or was introduced.
The <code class="literal">git log</code> command has a number of powerful tools for finding specific commits by the content of their messages or even the content of the diff they introduce.</p>
<p>If we want to find out for example when the <code class="literal">ZLIB_BUF_MAX</code> constant was originally introduced, we can tell Git to only show us the commits that either added or removed that string with the <code class="literal">-S</code> option.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log -SZLIB_BUF_MAX --oneline
e01503b zlib: allow feeding more than 4GB in one go
ef49a7a zlib: zlib can only process 4GB at a time</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If we look at the diff of those commits we can see that in <code class="literal">ef49a7a</code> the constant was introduced and in <code class="literal">e01503b</code> it was modified.</p>
<p>If you need to be more specific, you can provide a regular expression to search for with the <code class="literal">-G</code> option.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Line Log Search">
<h4 id="_line_log_search">Line Log Search</h4>
<p>Another fairly advanced log search that is insanely useful is the line history search.
This is a fairly recent addition and not very well known, but it can be really helpful.
It is called with the <code class="literal">-L</code> option to <code class="literal">git log</code> and will show you the history of a function or line of code in your codebase.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to see every change made to the function <code class="literal">git_deflate_bound</code> in the <code class="literal">zlib.c</code> file, we could run <code class="literal">git log -L :git_deflate_bound:zlib.c</code>.
This will try to figure out what the bounds of that function are and then look through the history and show us every change that was made to the function as a series of patches back to when the function was first created.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log -L :git_deflate_bound:zlib.c

<p>If Git can&#8217;t figure out how to match a function or method in your programming language, you can also provide it a regex.
For example, this would have done the same thing: <code class="literal">git log -L '/unsigned long git_deflate_bound/',/^}/:zlib.c</code>.
You could also give it a range of lines or a single line number and you&#8217;ll get the same sort of output.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Rewriting History">
<h2 id="r_rewriting_history">Rewriting History</h2>
<p>Many times, when working with Git, you may want to revise your commit history for some reason.
One of the great things about Git is that it allows you to make decisions at the last possible moment.
You can decide what files go into which commits right before you commit with the staging area, you can decide that you didn’t mean to be working on something yet with the stash command, and you can rewrite commits that already happened so they look like they happened in a different way.
This can involve changing the order of the commits, changing messages or modifying files in a commit, squashing together or splitting apart commits, or removing commits entirely – all before you share your work with others.</p>
<p>In this section, you’ll cover how to accomplish these very useful tasks so that you can make your commit history look the way you want before you share it with others.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Changing the Last Commit">
<h3 id="r_git_amend">Changing the Last Commit</h3>
<p>Changing your last commit is probably the most common rewriting of history that you’ll do.
You’ll often want to do two basic things to your last commit: change the commit message, or change the snapshot you just recorded by adding, changing and removing files.</p>
<p>If you only want to modify your last commit message, it’s very simple:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit --amend</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>That drops you into your text editor, which has your last commit message in it, ready for you to modify the message.
When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that message and makes it your new last commit.</p>
<p>If you’ve committed and then you want to change the snapshot you committed by adding or changing files, possibly because you forgot to add a newly created file when you originally committed, the process works basically the same way.
You stage the changes you want by editing a file and running <code class="literal">git add</code> on it or <code class="literal">git rm</code> to a tracked file, and the subsequent <code class="literal">git commit --amend</code> takes your current staging area and makes it the snapshot for the new commit.</p>
<p>You need to be careful with this technique because amending changes the SHA-1 of the commit.
It’s like a very small rebase – don’t amend your last commit if you’ve already pushed it.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Changing Multiple Commit Messages">
<h3 id="r_changing_multiple">Changing Multiple Commit Messages</h3>
<p>To modify a commit that is farther back in your history, you must move to more complex tools.
Git doesn’t have a modify-history tool, but you can use the rebase tool to rebase a series of commits onto the HEAD they were originally based on instead of moving them to another one.
With the interactive rebase tool, you can then stop after each commit you want to modify and change the message, add files, or do whatever you wish.
You can run rebase interactively by adding the <code class="literal">-i</code> option to <code class="literal">git rebase</code>.
You must indicate how far back you want to rewrite commits by telling the command which commit to rebase onto.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to change the last three commit messages, or any of the commit messages in that group, you supply as an argument to <code class="literal">git rebase -i</code> the parent of the last commit you want to edit, which is <code class="literal">HEAD~2^</code> or <code class="literal">HEAD~3</code>.
It may be easier to remember the <code class="literal">~3</code> because you’re trying to edit the last three commits; but keep in mind that you’re actually designating four commits ago, the parent of the last commit you want to edit:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rebase -i HEAD~3</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Remember again that this is a rebasing command – every commit included in the range <code class="literal">HEAD~3..HEAD</code> will be rewritten, whether you change the message or not.
Don’t include any commit you’ve already pushed to a central server – doing so will confuse other developers by providing an alternate version of the same change.</p>
<p>Running this command gives you a list of commits in your text editor that looks something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file

<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> Rebase 710f0f8..a5f4a0d onto 710f0f8
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> Commands:
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>  p, pick = use commit
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message

<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> However, <span style="font-weight: bold">if</span> you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> Note that empty commits are commented out</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>It’s important to note that these commits are listed in the opposite order than you normally see them using the <code class="literal">log</code> command.
If you run a <code class="literal">log</code>, you see something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --pretty=format:<span style="font-style: italic">&quot;%h %s&quot;</span> HEAD~3..HEAD
a5f4a0d added cat-file
310154e updated README formatting and added blame
f7f3f6d changed my name a bit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Notice the reverse order.
The interactive rebase gives you a script that it’s going to run.
It will start at the commit you specify on the command line (<code class="literal">HEAD~3</code>) and replay the changes introduced in each of these commits from top to bottom.
It lists the oldest at the top, rather than the newest, because that’s the first one it will replay.</p>
<p>You need to edit the script so that it stops at the commit you want to edit.
To do so, change the word ‘pick’ to the word ‘edit’ for each of the commits you want the script to stop after.
For example, to modify only the third commit message, you change the file to look like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>edit f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds you back to the last commit in that list and drops you on the command line with the following message:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rebase -i HEAD~3
Stopped at f7f3f6d... changed my name a bit
You can amend the commit now, with

       git commit --amend

Once you’re satisfied with your changes, run

       git rebase --continue</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>These instructions tell you exactly what to do.
Type</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit --amend</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Change the commit message, and exit the editor.
Then, run</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rebase --continue</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command will apply the other two commits automatically, and then you’re done.
If you change pick to edit on more lines, you can repeat these steps for each commit you change to edit.
Each time, Git will stop, let you amend the commit, and continue when you’re finished.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Reordering Commits">
<h3 id="_reordering_commits">Reordering Commits</h3>
<p>You can also use interactive rebases to reorder or remove commits entirely.
If you want to remove the “added cat-file” commit and change the order in which the other two commits are introduced, you can change the rebase script from this</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>to this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds your branch to the parent of these commits, applies <code class="literal">310154e</code> and then <code class="literal">f7f3f6d</code>, and then stops.
You effectively change the order of those commits and remove the “added cat-file” commit completely.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Squashing Commits">
<h3 id="r_squashing">Squashing Commits</h3>
<p>It’s also possible to take a series of commits and squash them down into a single commit with the interactive rebasing tool.
The script puts helpful instructions in the rebase message:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> Commands:

</figure>
<p>If, instead of “pick” or “edit”, you specify “squash”, Git applies both that change and the change directly before it and makes you merge the commit messages together.
So, if you want to make a single commit from these three commits, you make the script look like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
squash 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
squash a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git applies all three changes and then puts you back into the editor to merge the three commit messages:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> This is a combination of 3 commits.
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> The first commit<span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">&#39;</span>s message is:
changed my name a bit

<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> This is the 2nd commit message:

updated README formatting and added blame

<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span> This is the 3rd commit message:

added cat-file</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>When you save that, you have a single commit that introduces the changes of all three previous commits.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Splitting a Commit">
<h3 id="_splitting_a_commit">Splitting a Commit</h3>
<p>Splitting a commit undoes a commit and then partially stages and commits as many times as commits you want to end up with.
For example, suppose you want to split the middle commit of your three commits.
Instead of “updated README formatting and added blame”, you want to split it into two commits: “updated README formatting” for the first, and “added blame” for the second.
You can do that in the <code class="literal">rebase -i</code> script by changing the instruction on the commit you want to split to “edit”:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
edit 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Then, when the script drops you to the command line, you reset that commit, take the changes that have been reset, and create multiple commits out of them.
When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds to the parent of the first commit in your list, applies the first commit (<code class="literal">f7f3f6d</code>), applies the second (<code class="literal">310154e</code>), and drops you to the console.
There, you can do a mixed reset of that commit with <code class="literal">git reset HEAD^</code>, which effectively undoes that commit and leaves the modified files unstaged.
Now you can stage and commit files until you have several commits, and run <code class="literal">git rebase --continue</code> when you’re done:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git reset HEAD^
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add README
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit -m <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;updated README formatting&#39;</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add lib/simplegit.rb
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit -m <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;added blame&#39;</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rebase --continue</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Git applies the last commit (<code class="literal">a5f4a0d</code>) in the script, and your history looks like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log -4 --pretty=format:<span style="font-style: italic">&quot;%h %s&quot;</span>
1c002dd added cat-file
9b29157 added blame
35cfb2b updated README formatting
f3cc40e changed my name a bit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Once again, this changes the SHA-1s of all the commits in your list, so make sure no commit shows up in that list that you’ve already pushed to a shared repository.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="The Nuclear Option: filter-branch">
<h3 id="_the_nuclear_option_filter_branch">The Nuclear Option: filter-branch</h3>
<p>There is another history-rewriting option that you can use if you need to rewrite a larger number of commits in some scriptable way – for instance, changing your email address globally or removing a file from every commit.
The command is <code class="literal">filter-branch</code>, and it can rewrite huge swaths of your history, so you probably shouldn’t use it unless your project isn’t yet public and other people haven’t based work off the commits you’re about to rewrite.
However, it can be very useful.
You’ll learn a few of the common uses so you can get an idea of some of the things it’s capable of.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Removing a File from Every Commit">
<h4 id="r_removing_file_every_commit">Removing a File from Every Commit</h4>
<p>This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless <code class="literal">git add .</code>, and you want to remove it everywhere.
Perhaps you accidentally committed a file that contained a password, and you want to make your project open source.
<code class="literal">filter-branch</code> is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history.
To remove a file named <code class="literal">passwords.txt</code> from your entire history, you can use the <code class="literal">--tree-filter</code> option to <code class="literal">filter-branch</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git filter-branch --tree-filter <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;rm -f passwords.txt&#39;</span> HEAD
Rewrite 6b9b3cf04e7c5686a9cb838c3f36a8cb6a0fc2bd (21/21)
Ref &#39;refs/heads/master&#39; was rewritten</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">--tree-filter</code> option runs the specified command after each checkout of the project and then recommits the results.
In this case, you remove a file called <code class="literal">passwords.txt</code> from every snapshot, whether it exists or not.
If you want to remove all accidentally committed editor backup files, you can run something like <code class="literal">git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f *~' HEAD</code>.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to watch Git rewriting trees and commits and then move the branch pointer at the end.
It’s generally a good idea to do this in a testing branch and then hard-reset your master branch after you’ve determined the outcome is what you really want.
To run <code class="literal">filter-branch</code> on all your branches, you can pass <code class="literal">--all</code> to the command.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Making a Subdirectory the New Root">
<h4 id="_making_a_subdirectory_the_new_root">Making a Subdirectory the New Root</h4>
<p>Suppose you’ve done an import from another source control system and have subdirectories that make no sense (<code class="literal">trunk</code>, <code class="literal">tags</code>, and so on).
If you want to make the <code class="literal">trunk</code> subdirectory be the new project root for every commit, <code class="literal">filter-branch</code> can help you do that, too:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter trunk HEAD
Rewrite 856f0bf61e41a27326cdae8f09fe708d679f596f (12/12)
Ref &#39;refs/heads/master&#39; was rewritten</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now your new project root is what was in the <code class="literal">trunk</code> subdirectory each time.
Git will also automatically remove commits that did not affect the subdirectory.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Changing Email Addresses Globally">
<h4 id="_changing_email_addresses_globally">Changing Email Addresses Globally</h4>
<p>Another common case is that you forgot to run <code class="literal">git config</code> to set your name and email address before you started working, or perhaps you want to open-source a project at work and change all your work email addresses to your personal address.
In any case, you can change email addresses in multiple commits in a batch with <code class="literal">filter-branch</code> as well.
You need to be careful to change only the email addresses that are yours, so you use <code class="literal">--commit-filter</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git filter-branch --commit-filter <span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">&#39;</span>
        if [ &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&quot; = &quot;schacon@localhost&quot; ];
        then
                GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=&quot;Scott Chacon&quot;;
                GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=&quot;schacon@example.com&quot;;
                git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;;
        else
                git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;;
        fi&#39; HEAD</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This goes through and rewrites every commit to have your new address.
Because commits contain the SHA-1 values of their parents, this command changes every commit SHA-1 in your history, not just those that have the matching email address.</p>

</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Reset Demystified">
<h2 id="r_git_reset">Reset Demystified</h2>
<p>Before moving on to more specialized tools, let&#8217;s talk about <code class="literal">reset</code> and <code class="literal">checkout</code>.
These commands are two of the most confusing parts of Git when you first encounter them.
They do so many things, that it seems hopeless to actually understand them and employ them properly.
For this, we recommend a simple metaphor.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="The Three Trees">
<h3 id="_the_three_trees">The Three Trees</h3>
<p>An easier way to think about <code class="literal">reset</code> and <code class="literal">checkout</code> is through the mental frame of Git being a content manager of three different trees.
By “tree” here we really mean “collection of files”, not specifically the data structure.
(There are a few cases where the index doesn&#8217;t exactly act like a tree, but for our purposes it is easier to think about it this way for now.)</p>
<p>Git as a system manages and manipulates three trees in its normal operation:</p>
<div class="table">
<div class="content">
<table class="table table-framed-topbot table-grid-rows" style="width: 100%">
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tree</th>
<th>Role</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>HEAD</p></td>
<td><p>Last commit snapshot, next parent</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Index</p></td>
<td><p>Proposed next commit snapshot</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Working Directory</p></td>
<td><p>Sandbox</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<section class="sect3" title="The HEAD">
<h4 id="_the_head">The HEAD</h4>
<p>HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch.
That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created.
It&#8217;s generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of <strong>your last commit</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see what that snapshot looks like.
Here is an example of getting the actual directory listing and SHA-1 checksums for each file in the HEAD snapshot:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git cat-file -p HEAD

040000 tree 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19...   lib</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">cat-file</code> and <code class="literal">ls-tree</code> commands are “plumbing” commands that are used for lower level things and not really used in day-to-day work, but they help us see what&#8217;s going on here.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="The Index">
<h4 id="r_the_index">The Index</h4>
<p>The Index is your <strong>proposed next commit</strong>.
We&#8217;ve also been referring to this concept as Git&#8217;s “Staging Area” as this is what Git looks at when you run <code class="literal">git commit</code>.</p>
<p>Git populates this index with a list of all the file contents that were last checked out into your working directory and what they looked like when they were originally checked out.
You then replace some of those files with new versions of them, and <code class="literal">git commit</code> converts that into the tree for a new commit.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git ls-files -s
100644 a906cb2a4a904a152e80877d4088654daad0c859 0	README

100644 47c6340d6459e05787f644c2447d2595f5d3a54b 0	lib/simplegit.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Again, here we&#8217;re using <code class="literal">ls-files</code>, which is more of a behind the scenes command that shows you what your index currently looks like.</p>
<p>The index is not technically a tree structure – it&#8217;s actually implemented as a flattened manifest – but for our purposes it&#8217;s close enough.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="The Working Directory">
<h4 id="_the_working_directory">The Working Directory</h4>
<p>Finally, you have your working directory.
The other two trees store their content in an efficient but inconvenient manner, inside the <code class="literal">.git</code> folder.
The Working Directory unpacks them into actual files, which makes it much easier for you to edit them.
Think of the Working Directory as a <strong>sandbox</strong>, where you can try changes out before committing them to your staging area (index) and then to history.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> tree

</figure>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="The Workflow">
<h3 id="_the_workflow">The Workflow</h3>
<p>Git&#8217;s main purpose is to record snapshots of your project in successively better states, by manipulating these three trees.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-workflow.png" alt="reset workflow"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Let&#8217;s visualize this process: say you go into a new directory with a single file in it.
We&#8217;ll call this <strong>v1</strong> of the file, and we&#8217;ll indicate it in blue.
Now we run <code class="literal">git init</code>, which will create a Git repository with a HEAD reference which points to an unborn branch (<code class="literal">master</code> doesn&#8217;t exist yet).</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex1.png" alt="reset ex1"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>At this point, only the Working Directory tree has any content.</p>
<p>Now we want to commit this file, so we use <code class="literal">git add</code> to take content in the Working Directory and copy it to the Index.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex2.png" alt="reset ex2"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Then we run <code class="literal">git commit</code>, which takes the contents of the Index and saves it as a permanent snapshot, creates a commit object which points to that snapshot, and updates <code class="literal">master</code> to point to that commit.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex3.png" alt="reset ex3"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>If we run <code class="literal">git status</code>, we&#8217;ll see no changes, because all three trees are the same.</p>
<p>Now we want to make a change to that file and commit it.
We&#8217;ll go through the same process; first we change the file in our working directory.
Let&#8217;s call this <strong>v2</strong> of the file, and indicate it in red.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex4.png" alt="reset ex4"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>If we run <code class="literal">git status</code> right now, we&#8217;ll see the file in red as “Changes not staged for commit,” because that entry differs between the Index and the Working Directory.
Next we run <code class="literal">git add</code> on it to stage it into our Index.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex5.png" alt="reset ex5"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>At this point if we run <code class="literal">git status</code> we will see the file in green
under “Changes to be committed” because the Index and HEAD differ – that is, our proposed next commit is now different from our last commit.
Finally, we run <code class="literal">git commit</code> to finalize the commit.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex6.png" alt="reset ex6"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Now <code class="literal">git status</code> will give us no output, because all three trees are the same again.</p>
<p>Switching branches or cloning goes through a similar process.
When you checkout a branch, it changes <strong>HEAD</strong> to point to the new branch ref, populates your <strong>Index</strong> with the snapshot of that commit, then copies the contents of the <strong>Index</strong> into your <strong>Working Directory</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="The Role of Reset">
<h3 id="_the_role_of_reset">The Role of Reset</h3>
<p>The <code class="literal">reset</code> command makes more sense when viewed in this context.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these examples, let&#8217;s say that we&#8217;ve modified <code class="literal">file.txt</code> again and committed it a third time.
So now our history looks like this:</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-start.png" alt="reset start"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Let&#8217;s now walk through exactly what <code class="literal">reset</code> does when you call it.
It directly manipulates these three trees in a simple and predictable way.
It does up to three basic operations.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Step 1: Move HEAD">
<h4 id="_step_1_move_head">Step 1: Move HEAD</h4>
<p>The first thing <code class="literal">reset</code> will do is move what HEAD points to.
This isn&#8217;t the same as changing HEAD itself (which is what <code class="literal">checkout</code> does); <code class="literal">reset</code> moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to.
This means if HEAD is set to the <code class="literal">master</code> branch (i.e. you&#8217;re currently on the <code class="literal">master</code> branch), running <code class="literal">git reset 9e5e6a4</code> will start by making <code class="literal">master</code> point to <code class="literal">9e5e6a4</code>.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-soft.png" alt="reset soft"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>No matter what form of <code class="literal">reset</code> with a commit you invoke, this is the first thing it will always try to do.
With <code class="literal">reset --soft</code>, it will simply stop there.</p>
<p>Now take a second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it essentially undid the last <code class="literal">git commit</code> command.
When you run <code class="literal">git commit</code>, Git creates a new commit and moves the branch that HEAD points to up to it.
When you <code class="literal">reset</code> back to <code class="literal">HEAD~</code> (the parent of HEAD), you are moving the branch back to where it was, without changing the Index or Working Directory.
You could now update the Index and run <code class="literal">git commit</code> again to accomplish what <code class="literal">git commit --amend</code> would have done (see <a id="xref-r_git_amend" href="#r_git_amend" class="xref">Changing the Last Commit</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed)">
<h4 id="_step_2_updating_the_index_mixed">Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed)</h4>
<p>Note that if you run <code class="literal">git status</code> now you&#8217;ll see in green the difference between the Index and what the new HEAD is.</p>
<p>The next thing <code class="literal">reset</code> will do is to update the Index with the contents of whatever snapshot HEAD now points to.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-mixed.png" alt="reset mixed"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>If you specify the <code class="literal">--mixed</code> option, <code class="literal">reset</code> will stop at this point.
This is also the default, so if you specify no option at all (just <code class="literal">git reset HEAD~</code> in this case), this is where the command will stop.</p>
<p>Now take another second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it still undid your last <code class="literal">commit</code>, but also <em>unstaged</em> everything.
You rolled back to before you ran all your <code class="literal">git add</code> and <code class="literal">git commit</code> commands.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Step 3: Updating the Working Directory (--hard)">
<h4 id="_step_3_updating_the_working_directory_hard">Step 3: Updating the Working Directory (--hard)</h4>
<p>The third thing that <code class="literal">reset</code> will do is to make the Working Directory look like the Index.
If you use the <code class="literal">--hard</code> option, it will continue to this stage.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-hard.png" alt="reset hard"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>So let&#8217;s think about what just happened.
You undid your last commit, the <code class="literal">git add</code> and <code class="literal">git commit</code> commands, <strong>and</strong> all the work you did in your working directory.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this flag (<code class="literal">--hard</code>) is the only way to make the <code class="literal">reset</code> command dangerous, and one of the very few cases where Git will actually destroy data.
Any other invocation of <code class="literal">reset</code> can be pretty easily undone, but the <code class="literal">--hard</code> option cannot, since it forcibly overwrites files in the Working Directory.
In this particular case, we still have the <strong>v3</strong> version of our file in a commit in our Git DB, and we could get it back by looking at our <code class="literal">reflog</code>, but if we had not committed it, Git still would have overwritten the file and it would be unrecoverable.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Recap">
<h4 id="_recap">Recap</h4>
<p>The <code class="literal">reset</code> command overwrites these three trees in a specific order, stopping when you tell it to:</p>
<div class="ordered-list arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<span class="principal">Move the branch HEAD points to <em>(stop here if <code class="literal">--soft</code>)</em></span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Make the Index look like HEAD <em>(stop here unless <code class="literal">--hard</code>)</em></span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Make the Working Directory look like the Index</span>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Reset With a Path">
<h3 id="_reset_with_a_path">Reset With a Path</h3>
<p>That covers the behavior of <code class="literal">reset</code> in its basic form, but you can also provide it with a path to act upon.
If you specify a path, <code class="literal">reset</code> will skip step 1, and limit the remainder of its actions to a specific file or set of files.
This actually sort of makes sense – HEAD is just a pointer, and you can&#8217;t point to part of one commit and part of another.
But the Index and Working directory <em>can</em> be partially updated, so reset proceeds with steps 2 and 3.</p>
<p>So, assume we run <code class="literal">git reset file.txt</code>.
This form (since you did not specify a commit SHA-1 or branch, and you didn&#8217;t specify <code class="literal">--soft</code> or <code class="literal">--hard</code>) is shorthand for <code class="literal">git reset --mixed HEAD file.txt</code>, which will:</p>
<div class="ordered-list arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<span class="principal">Move the branch HEAD points to <em>(skipped)</em></span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Make the Index look like HEAD <em>(stop here)</em></span>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>So it essentially just copies <code class="literal">file.txt</code> from HEAD to the Index.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-path1.png" alt="reset path1"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>This has the practical effect of <em>unstaging</em> the file.
If we look at the diagram for that command and think about what <code class="literal">git add</code> does, they are exact opposites.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-path2.png" alt="reset path2"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>This is why the output of the <code class="literal">git status</code> command suggests that you run this to unstage a file.
(See <a id="xref--ch02-git-basics--r_unstaging" href="ch02-git-basics.xhtml#r_unstaging" class="xref">將已預存的檔案移出預存區</a> for more on this.)</p>
<p>We could just as easily not let Git assume we meant “pull the data from HEAD” by specifying a specific commit to pull that file version from.
We would just run something like <code class="literal">git reset eb43bf file.txt</code>.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-path3.png" alt="reset path3"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>This effectively does the same thing as if we had reverted the content of the file to <strong>v1</strong> in the Working Directory, ran <code class="literal">git add</code> on it, then reverted it back to <strong>v3</strong> again (without actually going through all those steps).
If we run <code class="literal">git commit</code> now, it will record a change that reverts that file back to <strong>v1</strong>, even though we never actually had it in our Working Directory again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that like <code class="literal">git add</code>, the <code class="literal">reset</code> command will accept a <code class="literal">--patch</code> option to unstage content on a hunk-by-hunk basis.
So you can selectively unstage or revert content.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Squashing">
<h3 id="_squashing">Squashing</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at how to do something interesting with this newfound power – squashing commits.</p>
<p>Say you have a series of commits with messages like “oops.”, “WIP” and “forgot this file”.
You can use <code class="literal">reset</code> to quickly and easily squash them into a single commit that makes you look really smart.
(<a id="xref-r_squashing" href="#r_squashing" class="xref">Squashing Commits</a> shows another way to do this, but in this example it&#8217;s simpler to use <code class="literal">reset</code>.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a project where the first commit has one file, the second commit added a new file and changed the first, and the third commit changed the first file again.
The second commit was a work in progress and you want to squash it down.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-squash-r1.png" alt="reset squash r1"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>You can run <code class="literal">git reset --soft HEAD~2</code> to move the HEAD branch back to an older commit (the first commit you want to keep):</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-squash-r2.png" alt="reset squash r2"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>And then simply run <code class="literal">git commit</code> again:</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-squash-r3.png" alt="reset squash r3"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Now you can see that your reachable history, the history you would push, now looks like you had one commit with <code class="literal">file-a.txt</code> v1, then a second that both modified <code class="literal">file-a.txt</code> to v3 and added <code class="literal">file-b.txt</code>.
The commit with the v2 version of the file is no longer in the history.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Check It Out">
<h3 id="_check_it_out">Check It Out</h3>
<p>Finally, you may wonder what the difference between <code class="literal">checkout</code> and <code class="literal">reset</code> is.
Like <code class="literal">reset</code>, <code class="literal">checkout</code> manipulates the three trees, and it is a bit different depending on whether you give the command a file path or not.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Without Paths">
<h4 id="_without_paths">Without Paths</h4>
<p>Running <code class="literal">git checkout [branch]</code> is pretty similar to running <code class="literal">git reset --hard [branch]</code> in that it updates all three trees for you to look like <code class="literal">[branch]</code>, but there are two important differences.</p>
<p>First, unlike <code class="literal">reset --hard</code>, <code class="literal">checkout</code> is working-directory safe; it will check to make sure it&#8217;s not blowing away files that have changes to them.
Actually, it&#8217;s a bit smarter than that – it tries to do a trivial merge in the Working Directory, so all of the files you <em>haven&#8217;t</em> changed in will be updated.
<code class="literal">reset --hard</code>, on the other hand, will simply replace everything across the board without checking.</p>
<p>The second important difference is how it updates HEAD.
Where <code class="literal">reset</code> will move the branch that HEAD points to, <code class="literal">checkout</code> will move HEAD itself to point to another branch.</p>
<p>For instance, say we have <code class="literal">master</code> and <code class="literal">develop</code> branches which point at different commits, and we&#8217;re currently on <code class="literal">develop</code> (so HEAD points to it).
If we run <code class="literal">git reset master</code>, <code class="literal">develop</code> itself will now point to the same commit that <code class="literal">master</code> does.
If we instead run <code class="literal">git checkout master</code>, <code class="literal">develop</code> does not move, HEAD itself does.
HEAD will now point to <code class="literal">master</code>.</p>
<p>So, in both cases we&#8217;re moving HEAD to point to commit A, but <em>how</em> we do so is very different.
<code class="literal">reset</code> will move the branch HEAD points to, <code class="literal">checkout</code> moves HEAD itself.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-checkout.png" alt="reset checkout"/>
</div>
</figure>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="With Paths">
<h4 id="_with_paths">With Paths</h4>
<p>The other way to run <code class="literal">checkout</code> is with a file path, which, like <code class="literal">reset</code>, does not move HEAD.
It is just like <code class="literal">git reset [branch] file</code> in that it updates the index with that file at that commit, but it also overwrites the file in the working directory.
It would be exactly like <code class="literal">git reset --hard [branch] file</code> (if <code class="literal">reset</code> would let you run that) – it&#8217;s not working-directory safe, and it does not move HEAD.</p>
<p>Also, like <code class="literal">git reset</code> and <code class="literal">git add</code>, <code class="literal">checkout</code> will accept a <code class="literal">--patch</code> option to allow you to selectively revert file contents on a hunk-by-hunk basis.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Summary">
<h3 id="_summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Hopefully now you understand and feel more comfortable with the <code class="literal">reset</code> command, but are probably still a little confused about how exactly it differs from <code class="literal">checkout</code> and could not possibly remember all the rules of the different invocations.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a cheat-sheet for which commands affect which trees.
The “HEAD” column reads “REF” if that command moves the reference (branch) that HEAD points to, and “HEAD” if it moves HEAD itself.
Pay especial attention to the <em>WD Safe?</em> column – if it says <strong>NO</strong>, take a second to think before running that command.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Advanced Merging">
<h2 id="r_advanced_merging">Advanced Merging</h2>
<p>Merging in Git is typically fairly easy.
Since Git makes it easy to merge another branch multiple times, it means that you can have a very long lived branch but you can keep it up to date as you go, solving small conflicts often, rather than be surprised by one enormous conflict at the end of the series.</p>
<p>However, sometimes tricky conflicts do occur.
Unlike some other version control systems, Git does not try to be overly clever about merge conflict resolution.
Git&#8217;s philosophy is to be smart about determining when a merge resolution is unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be clever about automatically resolving it.
Therefore, if you wait too long to merge two branches that diverge quickly, you can run into some issues.</p>
<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll go over what some of those issues might be and what tools Git gives you to help handle these more tricky situations.
We&#8217;ll also cover some of the different, non-standard types of merges you can do, as well as see how to back out of merges that you&#8217;ve done.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Merge Conflicts">
<h3 id="_merge_conflicts">Merge Conflicts</h3>
<p>While we covered some basics on resolving merge conflicts in <a id="xref--ch03-git-branching--r_basic_merge_conflicts" href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml#r_basic_merge_conflicts" class="xref">合併衝突的基本解法</a>, for more complex conflicts, Git provides a few tools to help you figure out what&#8217;s going on and how to better deal with the conflict.</p>
<p>First of all, if at all possible, try to make sure your working directory is clean before doing a merge that may have conflicts.
If you have work in progress, either commit it to a temporary branch or stash it.
This makes it so that you can undo <strong>anything</strong> you try here.
If you have unsaved changes in your working directory when you try a merge, some of these tips may help you lose that work.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through a very simple example.
We have a super simple Ruby file that prints <em>hello world</em>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-ruby"><code><span></span><span style="font-style: italic">#! /usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold">def</span> hello
  puts <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;hello world&#39;</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">end</span>

hello()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>In our repository, we create a new branch named <code class="literal">whitespace</code> and proceed to change all the Unix line endings to DOS line endings, essentially changing every line of the file, but just with whitespace.
Then we change the line “hello world” to “hello mundo”.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout -b whitespace

<p>Now we switch back to our <code class="literal">master</code> branch and add some documentation for the function.</p>

<p>Now we try to merge in our <code class="literal">whitespace</code> branch and we&#8217;ll get conflicts because of the whitespace changes.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge whitespace
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb

</figure>
<section class="sect3" title="Aborting a Merge">
<h4 id="r_abort_merge">Aborting a Merge</h4>
<p>We now have a few options.
First, let&#8217;s cover how to get out of this situation.
If you perhaps weren&#8217;t expecting conflicts and don&#8217;t want to quite deal with the situation yet, you can simply back out of the merge with <code class="literal">git merge --abort</code>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status -sb
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span><span style="font-style: italic"># master</span>
UU hello.rb

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge --abort

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status -sb
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span><span style="font-style: italic"># master</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">git merge --abort</code> option tries to revert back to your state before you ran the merge.
The only cases where it may not be able to do this perfectly would be if you had unstashed, uncommitted changes in your working directory when you ran it, otherwise it should work fine.</p>
<p>If for some reason you just want to start over, you can also run <code class="literal">git reset --hard HEAD</code>, and your repository will be back to the last committed state.
Remember that any uncommitted work will be lost, so make sure you don&#8217;t want any of your changes.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Ignoring Whitespace">
<h4 id="_ignoring_whitespace">Ignoring Whitespace</h4>
<p>In this specific case, the conflicts are whitespace related.
We know this because the case is simple, but it&#8217;s also pretty easy to tell in real cases when looking at the conflict because every line is removed on one side and added again on the other.
By default, Git sees all of these lines as being changed, so it can&#8217;t merge the files.</p>
<p>The default merge strategy can take arguments though, and a few of them are about properly ignoring whitespace changes.
If you see that you have a lot of whitespace issues in a merge, you can simply abort it and do it again, this time with <code class="literal">-Xignore-all-space</code> or <code class="literal">-Xignore-space-change</code>.
The first option ignores whitespace <strong>completely</strong> when comparing lines, the second treats sequences of one or more whitespace characters as equivalent.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the &#39;recursive&#39; strategy.
 hello.rb | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Since in this case, the actual file changes were not conflicting, once we ignore the whitespace changes, everything merges just fine.</p>
<p>This is a lifesaver if you have someone on your team who likes to occasionally reformat everything from spaces to tabs or vice-versa.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Manual File Re-merging">
<h4 id="r_manual_remerge">Manual File Re-merging</h4>
<p>Though Git handles whitespace pre-processing pretty well, there are other types of changes that perhaps Git can&#8217;t handle automatically, but are scriptable fixes.
As an example, let&#8217;s pretend that Git could not handle the whitespace change and we needed to do it by hand.</p>
<p>What we really need to do is run the file we&#8217;re trying to merge in through a <code class="literal">dos2unix</code> program before trying the actual file merge.
So how would we do that?</p>
<p>First, we get into the merge conflict state.
Then we want to get copies of my version of the file, their version (from the branch we&#8217;re merging in) and the common version (from where both sides branched off).
Then we want to fix up either their side or our side and re-try the merge again for just this single file.</p>
<p>Getting the three file versions is actually pretty easy.
Git stores all of these versions in the index under “stages” which each have numbers associated with them.
Stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is your version and stage 3 is from the <code class="literal">MERGE_HEAD</code>, the version you&#8217;re merging in (“theirs”).</p>
<p>You can extract a copy of each of these versions of the conflicted file with the <code class="literal">git show</code> command and a special syntax.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show :1:hello.rb &gt; hello.common.rb
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show :2:hello.rb &gt; hello.ours.rb
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show :3:hello.rb &gt; hello.theirs.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you want to get a little more hard core, you can also use the <code class="literal">ls-files -u</code> plumbing command to get the actual SHA-1s of the Git blobs for each of these files.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git ls-files -u
100755 ac51efdc3df4f4fd328d1a02ad05331d8e2c9111 1	hello.rb
100755 36c06c8752c78d2aff89571132f3bf7841a7b5c3 2	hello.rb
100755 e85207e04dfdd5eb0a1e9febbc67fd837c44a1cd 3	hello.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">:1:hello.rb</code> is just a shorthand for looking up that blob SHA-1.</p>
<p>Now that we have the content of all three stages in our working directory, we can manually fix up theirs to fix the whitespace issue and re-merge the file with the little-known <code class="literal">git merge-file</code> command which does just that.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> dos2unix hello.theirs.rb
dos2unix: converting file hello.theirs.rb to Unix format ...

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge-file -p <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">\</span>

  end

  hello()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>At this point we have nicely merged the file.
In fact, this actually works better than the <code class="literal">ignore-space-change</code> option because this actually fixes the whitespace changes before merge instead of simply ignoring them.
In the <code class="literal">ignore-space-change</code> merge, we actually ended up with a few lines with DOS line endings, making things mixed.</p>
<p>If you want to get an idea before finalizing this commit about what was actually changed between one side or the other, you can ask <code class="literal">git diff</code> to compare what is in your working directory that you&#8217;re about to commit as the result of the merge to any of these stages.
Let&#8217;s go through them all.</p>
<p>To compare your result to what you had in your branch before the merge, in other words, to see what the merge introduced, you can run <code class="literal">git diff --ours</code></p>

<p>So here we can easily see that what happened in our branch, what we&#8217;re actually introducing to this file with this merge, is changing that single line.</p>
<p>If we want to see how the result of the merge differed from what was on their side, you can run <code class="literal">git diff --theirs</code>.

<p>Perhaps we&#8217;re not happy with the resolution at this point for some reason, or maybe manually editing one or both sides still didn&#8217;t work well and we need more context.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s change up the example a little.
For this example, we have two longer lived branches that each have a few commits in them but create a legitimate content conflict when merged.</p>

<p>We now have three unique commits that live only on the <code class="literal">master</code> branch and three others that live on the <code class="literal">mundo</code> branch.

<p>Both sides of the merge added content to this file, but some of the commits modified the file in the same place that caused this conflict.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore a couple of tools that you now have at your disposal to determine how this conflict came to be.
Perhaps it&#8217;s not obvious how exactly you should fix this conflict.
You need more context.</p>
<p>One helpful tool is <code class="literal">git checkout</code> with the ‘--conflict’ option.
This will re-checkout the file again and replace the merge conflict markers.
This can be useful if you want to reset the markers and try to resolve them again.</p>
<p>You can pass <code class="literal">--conflict</code> either <code class="literal">diff3</code> or <code class="literal">merge</code> (which is the default).
If you pass it <code class="literal">diff3</code>, Git will use a slightly different version of conflict markers, not only giving you the “ours” and “theirs” versions, but also the “base” version inline to give you more context.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout --conflict=diff3 hello.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Once we run that, the file will look like this instead:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-ruby"><code><span></span><span style="font-style: italic">#! /usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold">def</span> hello
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ours
  puts <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;hola world&#39;</span>
||||||| base
  puts <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;hello world&#39;</span>
=======
  puts <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;hello mundo&#39;</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs
<span style="font-weight: bold">end</span>

hello()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you like this format, you can set it as the default for future merge conflicts by setting the <code class="literal">merge.conflictstyle</code> setting to <code class="literal">diff3</code>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">git checkout</code> command can also take <code class="literal">--ours</code> and <code class="literal">--theirs</code> options, which can be a really fast way of just choosing either one side or the other without merging things at all.</p>
<p>This can be particularly useful for conflicts of binary files where you can simply choose one side, or where you only want to merge certain files in from another branch - you can do the merge and then checkout certain files from one side or the other before committing.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Merge Log">
<h4 id="r_merge_log">Merge Log</h4>
<p>Another useful tool when resolving merge conflicts is <code class="literal">git log</code>.
This can help you get context on what may have contributed to the conflicts.
Reviewing a little bit of history to remember why two lines of development were touching the same area of code can be really helpful sometimes.</p>
<p>To get a full list of all of the unique commits that were included in either branch involved in this merge, we can use the “triple dot” syntax that we learned in <a id="xref-r_triple_dot" href="#r_triple_dot" class="xref">Triple Dot</a>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline --left-right HEAD...MERGE_HEAD
&lt; f1270f7 update README
&lt; 9af9d3b add a README
&lt; 694971d update phrase to hola world
<span style="font-weight: bold">&gt;</span> e3eb223 add more tests
<span style="font-weight: bold">&gt;</span> 7cff591 add testing script
<span style="font-weight: bold">&gt;</span> c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>That&#8217;s a nice list of the six total commits involved, as well as which line of development each commit was on.</p>
<p>We can further simplify this though to give us much more specific context.
If we add the <code class="literal">--merge</code> option to <code class="literal">git log</code>, it will only show the commits in either side of the merge that touch a file that&#8217;s currently conflicted.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline --left-right --merge
&lt; 694971d update phrase to hola world
<span style="font-weight: bold">&gt;</span> c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you run that with the <code class="literal">-p</code> option instead, you get just the diffs to the file that ended up in conflict.
This can be <strong>really</strong> helpful in quickly giving you the context you need to help understand why something conflicts and how to more intelligently resolve it.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Combined Diff Format">
<h4 id="_combined_diff_format">Combined Diff Format</h4>
<p>Since Git stages any merge results that are successful, when you run <code class="literal">git diff</code> while in a conflicted merge state, you only get what is currently still in conflict.
This can be helpful to see what you still have to resolve.</p>
<p>When you run <code class="literal">git diff</code> directly after a merge conflict, it will give you information in a rather unique diff output format.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff
diff --cc hello.rb
index 0399cd5,59727f0..0000000
--- a/hello.rb
+++ b/hello.rb
@@@ -1,7 -1,7 +1,11 @@@
<span style="font-weight: bold">  #</span>! /usr/bin/env ruby

  def hello
++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
 +  puts &#39;hola world&#39;
++=======
+   puts &#39;hello mundo&#39;
++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mundo
  end

  hello()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The format is called “Combined Diff” and gives you two columns of data next to each line.
The first column shows you if that line is different (added or removed) between the “ours” branch and the file in your working directory and the second column does the same between the “theirs” branch and your working directory copy.</p>
<p>So in that example you can see that the <code class="literal">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines are in the working copy but were not in either side of the merge.
This makes sense because the merge tool stuck them in there for our context, but we&#8217;re expected to remove them.</p>
<p>If we resolve the conflict and run <code class="literal">git diff</code> again, we&#8217;ll see the same thing, but it&#8217;s a little more useful.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> vim hello.rb
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff
diff --cc hello.rb
index 0399cd5,59727f0..0000000
--- a/hello.rb
+++ b/hello.rb
@@@ -1,7 -1,7 +1,7 @@@
<span style="font-weight: bold">  #</span>! /usr/bin/env ruby

  def hello
-   puts &#39;hola world&#39;
 -  puts &#39;hello mundo&#39;
++  puts &#39;hola mundo&#39;
  end

  hello()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This shows us that “hola world” was in our side but not in the working copy, that “hello mundo” was in their side but not in the working copy and finally that “hola mundo” was not in either side but is now in the working copy.
This can be useful to review before committing the resolution.</p>
<p>You can also get this from the <code class="literal">git log</code> for any merge to see how something was resolved after the fact.
Git will output this format if you run <code class="literal">git show</code> on a merge commit, or if you add a <code class="literal">--cc</code> option to a <code class="literal">git log -p</code> (which by default only shows patches for non-merge commits).</p>

<section class="sect2" title="Undoing Merges">
<h3 id="r_undoing_merges">Undoing Merges</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to create a merge commit, you&#8217;ll probably make some by mistake.
One of the great things about working with Git is that it&#8217;s okay to make mistakes, because it&#8217;s possible (and in many cases easy) to fix them.</p>
<p>Merge commits are no different.
Let&#8217;s say you started work on a topic branch, accidentally merged it into <code class="literal">master</code>, and now your commit history looks like this:</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-start.png" alt="Accidental merge commit."/>
</div>
<figcaption>圖表 2. Accidental merge commit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two ways to approach this problem, depending on what your desired outcome is.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Fix the references">
<h4 id="_fix_the_references">Fix the references</h4>
<p>If the unwanted merge commit only exists on your local repository, the easiest and best solution is to move the branches so that they point where you want them to.
In most cases, if you follow the errant <code class="literal">git merge</code> with <code class="literal">git reset --hard HEAD~</code>, this will reset the branch pointers so they look like this:</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-reset.png" alt="History after `git reset --hard HEAD~`."/>
</div>
<figcaption>圖表 3. History after <code class="literal">git reset --hard HEAD~</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We covered <code class="literal">reset</code> back in <a id="xref-r_git_reset" href="#r_git_reset" class="xref">Reset Demystified</a>, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to figure out what&#8217;s going on here.
Here&#8217;s a quick refresher: <code class="literal">reset --hard</code> usually goes through three steps:</p>
<div class="ordered-list arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<span class="principal">Move the branch HEAD points to.
In this case, we want to move <code class="literal">master</code> to where it was before the merge commit (<code class="literal">C6</code>).</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Make the index look like HEAD.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Make the working directory look like the index.</span>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The downside of this approach is that it&#8217;s rewriting history, which can be problematic with a shared repository.
Check out <a id="xref--ch03-git-branching--r_rebase_peril" href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml#r_rebase_peril" class="xref">使用衍和的危險</a> for more on what can happen; the short version is that if other people have the commits you&#8217;re rewriting, you should probably avoid <code class="literal">reset</code>.
This approach also won&#8217;t work if any other commits have been created since the merge; moving the refs would effectively lose those changes.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Reverse the commit">
<h4 id="r_reverse_commit">Reverse the commit</h4>
<p>If moving the branch pointers around isn&#8217;t going to work for you, Git gives you the option of making a new commit which undoes all the changes from an existing one.
Git calls this operation a “revert”, and in this particular scenario, you&#8217;d invoke it like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git revert -m 1 HEAD
[master b1d8379] Revert &quot;Merge branch &#39;topic&#39;&quot;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">-m 1</code> flag indicates which parent is the “mainline” and should be kept.
When you invoke a merge into <code class="literal">HEAD</code> (<code class="literal">git merge topic</code>), the new commit has two parents: the first one is <code class="literal">HEAD</code> (<code class="literal">C6</code>), and the second is the tip of the branch being merged in (<code class="literal">C4</code>).
In this case, we want to undo all the changes introduced by merging in parent #2 (<code class="literal">C4</code>), while keeping all the content from parent #1 (<code class="literal">C6</code>).</p>
<p>The history with the revert commit looks like this:</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-revert.png" alt="History after `git revert -m 1`."/>
</div>
<figcaption>圖表 4. History after <code class="literal">git revert -m 1</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The new commit <code class="literal">^M</code> has exactly the same contents as <code class="literal">C6</code>, so starting from here it&#8217;s as if the merge never happened, except that the now-unmerged commits are still in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>'s history.
Git will get confused if you try to merge <code class="literal">topic</code> into <code class="literal">master</code> again:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge topic
Already up-to-date.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing in <code class="literal">topic</code> that isn&#8217;t already reachable from <code class="literal">master</code>.
What&#8217;s worse, if you add work to <code class="literal">topic</code> and merge again, Git will only bring in the changes <em>since</em> the reverted merge:</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-revert2.png" alt="History with a bad merge."/>
</div>
<figcaption>圖表 5. History with a bad merge</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The best way around this is to un-revert the original merge, since now you want to bring in the changes that were reverted out, <strong>then</strong> create a new merge commit:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git revert ^M
[master 09f0126] Revert &quot;Revert &quot;Merge branch &#39;topic&#39;&quot;&quot;
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge topic</code></pre>
</figure>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-revert3.png" alt="History after re-merging a reverted merge."/>
</div>
<figcaption>圖表 6. History after re-merging a reverted merge</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this example, <code class="literal">M</code> and <code class="literal">^M</code> cancel out.
<code class="literal">^^M</code> effectively merges in the changes from <code class="literal">C3</code> and <code class="literal">C4</code>, and <code class="literal">C8</code> merges in the changes from <code class="literal">C7</code>, so now <code class="literal">topic</code> is fully merged.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Other Types of Merges">
<h3 id="_other_types_of_merges">Other Types of Merges</h3>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve covered the normal merge of two branches, normally handled with what is called the “recursive” strategy of merging.
There are other ways to merge branches together however.
Let&#8217;s cover a few of them quickly.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Our or Theirs Preference">
<h4 id="_our_or_theirs_preference">Our or Theirs Preference</h4>
<p>First of all, there is another useful thing we can do with the normal “recursive” mode of merging.
We&#8217;ve already seen the <code class="literal">ignore-all-space</code> and <code class="literal">ignore-space-change</code> options which are passed with a <code class="literal">-X</code> but we can also tell Git to favor one side or the other when it sees a conflict.</p>
<p>By default, when Git sees a conflict between two branches being merged, it will add merge conflict markers into your code and mark the file as conflicted and let you resolve it.
If you would prefer for Git to simply choose a specific side and ignore the other side instead of letting you manually resolve the conflict, you can pass the <code class="literal">merge</code> command either a <code class="literal">-Xours</code> or <code class="literal">-Xtheirs</code>.</p>
<p>If Git sees this, it will not add conflict markers.
Any differences that are mergeable, it will merge.
Any differences that conflict, it will simply choose the side you specify in whole, including binary files.</p>
<p>If we go back to the “hello world” example we were using before, we can see that merging in our branch causes conflicts.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Resolved &#39;hello.rb&#39; using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>However if we run it with <code class="literal">-Xours</code> or <code class="literal">-Xtheirs</code> it does not.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge -Xours mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the &#39;recursive&#39; strategy.
 hello.rb | 2 +-
 test.sh  | 2 ++
 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 test.sh</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>In that case, instead of getting conflict markers in the file with “hello mundo” on one side and “hola world” on the other, it will simply pick “hola world”.
However, all the other non-conflicting changes on that branch are merged successfully in.</p>
<p>This option can also be passed to the <code class="literal">git merge-file</code> command we saw earlier by running something like <code class="literal">git merge-file --ours</code> for individual file merges.</p>
<p>If you want to do something like this but not have Git even try to merge changes from the other side in, there is a more draconian option, which is the “ours” merge <em>strategy</em>.
This is different from the “ours” recursive merge <em>option</em>.</p>
<p>This will basically do a fake merge.
It will record a new merge commit with both branches as parents, but it will not even look at the branch you&#8217;re merging in.
It will simply record as the result of the merge the exact code in your current branch.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge -s ours mundo
Merge made by the &#39;ours&#39; strategy.
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff HEAD HEAD~
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that there is no difference between the branch we were on and the result of the merge.</p>
<p>This can often be useful to basically trick Git into thinking that a branch is already merged when doing a merge later on.
For example, say you branched off a <code class="literal">release</code> branch and have done some work on it that you will want to merge back into your <code class="literal">master</code> branch at some point.
In the meantime some bugfix on <code class="literal">master</code> needs to be backported into your <code class="literal">release</code> branch.
You can merge the bugfix branch into the <code class="literal">release</code> branch and also <code class="literal">merge -s ours</code> the same branch into your <code class="literal">master</code> branch (even though the fix is already there) so when you later merge the <code class="literal">release</code> branch again, there are no conflicts from the bugfix.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Subtree Merging">
<h4 id="r_subtree_merge">Subtree Merging</h4>
<p>The idea of the subtree merge is that you have two projects, and one of the projects maps to a subdirectory of the other one.
When you specify a subtree merge, Git is often smart enough to figure out that one is a subtree of the other and merge appropriately.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll go through an example of adding a separate project into an existing project and then merging the code of the second into a subdirectory of the first.</p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ll add the Rack application to our project.
We&#8217;ll add the Rack project as a remote reference in our own project and then check it out into its own branch:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote add rack_remote https://github.com/rack/rack
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git fetch rack_remote --no-tags

 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; rack_remote/master
 * [new branch]      rack-0.4   -&gt; rack_remote/rack-0.4
 * [new branch]      rack-0.9   -&gt; rack_remote/rack-0.9
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout -b rack_branch rack_remote/master
Branch rack_branch set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/rack_remote/master.
Switched to a new branch &quot;rack_branch&quot;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now we have the root of the Rack project in our <code class="literal">rack_branch</code> branch and our own project in the <code class="literal">master</code> branch.
If you check out one and then the other, you can see that they have different project roots:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> ls
AUTHORS         KNOWN-ISSUES   Rakefile      contrib         lib
COPYING         README         bin           example         test
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout master
Switched to branch &quot;master&quot;
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> ls
README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This is sort of a strange concept.
Not all the branches in your repository actually have to be branches of the same project.
It&#8217;s not common, because it&#8217;s rarely helpful, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to have branches contain completely different histories.</p>
<p>In this case, we want to pull the Rack project into our <code class="literal">master</code> project as a subdirectory.
We can do that in Git with <code class="literal">git read-tree</code>.
You’ll learn more about <code class="literal">read-tree</code> and its friends in <a href="ch10-git-internals.xhtml" class="xref">Git Internals</a>, but for now know that it reads the root tree of one branch into your current staging area and working directory.
We just switched back to your <code class="literal">master</code> branch, and we pull the <code class="literal">rack_branch</code> branch into the <code class="literal">rack</code> subdirectory of our <code class="literal">master</code> branch of our main project:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git read-tree --prefix=rack/ -u rack_branch</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>When we commit, it looks like we have all the Rack files under that subdirectory – as though we copied them in from a tarball.
What gets interesting is that we can fairly easily merge changes from one of the branches to the other.
So, if the Rack project updates, we can pull in upstream changes by switching to that branch and pulling:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout rack_branch
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git pull</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Then, we can merge those changes back into our <code class="literal">master</code> branch.
To pull in the changes and prepopulate the commit message, use the <code class="literal">--squash</code> option, as well as the recursive merge strategy&#8217;s <code class="literal">-Xsubtree</code> option.
(The recursive strategy is the default here, but we include it for clarity.)</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout master
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge --squash -s recursive -Xsubtree=rack rack_branch
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>All the changes from the Rack project are merged in and ready to be committed locally.
You can also do the opposite – make changes in the <code class="literal">rack</code> subdirectory of your master branch and then merge them into your <code class="literal">rack_branch</code> branch later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.</p>
<p>This gives us a way to have a workflow somewhat similar to the submodule workflow without using submodules (which we will cover in <a id="xref-r_git_submodules" href="#r_git_submodules" class="xref">Submodules</a>).
We can keep branches with other related projects in our repository and subtree merge them into our project occasionally.
It is nice in some ways, for example all the code is committed to a single place.
However, it has other drawbacks in that it&#8217;s a bit more complex and easier to make mistakes in reintegrating changes or accidentally pushing a branch into an unrelated repository.</p>
<p>Another slightly weird thing is that to get a diff between what you have in your <code class="literal">rack</code> subdirectory and the code in your <code class="literal">rack_branch</code> branch – to see if you need to merge them – you can’t use the normal <code class="literal">diff</code> command.
Instead, you must run <code class="literal">git diff-tree</code> with the branch you want to compare to:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff-tree -p rack_branch</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Or, to compare what is in your <code class="literal">rack</code> subdirectory with what the <code class="literal">master</code> branch on the server was the last time you fetched, you can run</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff-tree -p rack_remote/master</code></pre>
</figure>

<p>The <code class="literal">git rerere</code> functionality is a bit of a hidden feature.
The name stands for “reuse recorded resolution” and as the name implies, it allows you to ask Git to remember how you&#8217;ve resolved a hunk conflict so that the next time it sees the same conflict, Git can automatically resolve it for you.</p>
<p>There are a number of scenarios in which this functionality might be really handy.
One of the examples that is mentioned in the documentation is if you want to make sure a long lived topic branch will merge cleanly but don&#8217;t want to have a bunch of intermediate merge commits.
With <code class="literal">rerere</code> turned on you can merge occasionally, resolve the conflicts, then back out the merge.
If you do this continuously, then the final merge should be easy because <code class="literal">rerere</code> can just do everything for you automatically.</p>
<p>This same tactic can be used if you want to keep a branch rebased so you don&#8217;t have to deal with the same rebasing conflicts each time you do it.
Or if you want to take a branch that you merged and fixed a bunch of conflicts and then decide to rebase it instead - you likely won&#8217;t have to do all the same conflicts again.</p>
<p>Another situation is where you merge a bunch of evolving topic branches together into a testable head occasionally, as the Git project itself often does.
If the tests fail, you can rewind the merges and re-do them without the topic branch that made the tests fail without having to re-resolve the conflicts again.</p>
<p>To enable the <code class="literal">rerere</code> functionality, you simply have to run this config setting:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global rerere.enabled true</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can also turn it on by creating the <code class="literal">.git/rr-cache</code> directory in a specific repository, but the config setting is clearer and it can be done globally.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see a simple example, similar to our previous one.
Let&#8217;s say we have a file named <code class="literal">hello.rb</code> that looks like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-ruby"><code><span></span><span style="font-style: italic">#! /usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold">def</span> hello
  puts <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;hello world&#39;</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">end</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>In one branch we change the word “hello” to “hola”, then in another branch we change the “world” to “mundo”, just like before.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rerere1.png" alt="rerere1"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>When we merge the two branches together, we&#8217;ll get a merge conflict:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git merge i18n-world
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Recorded preimage for &#39;hello.rb&#39;
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You should notice the new line <code class="literal">Recorded preimage for FILE</code> in there.
Otherwise it should look exactly like a normal merge conflict.
At this point, <code class="literal">rerere</code> can tell us a few things.
Normally, you might run <code class="literal">git status</code> at this point to see what all conflicted:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status

<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>   (use <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to mark resolution)
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span>	both modified:      hello.rb
<span style="font-weight: bold">#</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>However, <code class="literal">git rerere</code> will also tell you what it has recorded the pre-merge state for with <code class="literal">git rerere status</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rerere status
hello.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>And <code class="literal">git rerere diff</code> will show the current state of the resolution - what you started with to resolve and what you&#8217;ve resolved it to.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rerere diff

</figure>
<p>Also (and this isn&#8217;t really related to <code class="literal">rerere</code>), you can use <code class="literal">ls-files -u</code> to see the conflicted files and the before, left and right versions:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git ls-files -u

100644 54336ba847c3758ab604876419607e9443848474 3	hello.rb</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now you can resolve it to just be <code class="literal">puts 'hola mundo'</code> and you can run the <code class="literal">rerere diff</code> command again to see what rerere will remember:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rerere diff

 end</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>So that basically says, when Git sees a hunk conflict in a <code class="literal">hello.rb</code> file that has “hello mundo” on one side and “hola world” on the other, it will resolve it to “hola mundo”.</p>
<p>Now we can mark it as resolved and commit it:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add hello.rb

</figure>
<p>You can see that it "Recorded resolution for FILE".</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rerere2.png" alt="rerere2"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s undo that merge and then rebase it on top of our master branch instead.
We can move our branch back by using <code class="literal">reset</code> as we saw in <a href="#r_git_reset" class="xref">Reset Demystified</a>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git reset --hard HEAD^

</figure>
<p>Our merge is undone.
Now let&#8217;s rebase the topic branch.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout i18n-world

</figure>
<p>Now, we got the same merge conflict like we expected, but take a look at the <code class="literal">Resolved FILE using previous resolution</code> line.
If we look at the file, we&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s already been resolved, there are no merge conflict markers in it.</p>
<figure class="listing">

<p>Also, <code class="literal">git diff</code> will show you how it was automatically re-resolved:</p>

</figure>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">

<p>You can also recreate the conflicted file state with the <code class="literal">checkout</code> command:</p>

end</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We saw an example of this in <a id="xref-r_advanced_merging" href="#r_advanced_merging" class="xref">Advanced Merging</a>.
For now though, let&#8217;s re-resolve it by just running <code class="literal">rerere</code> again:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rerere

def hello
  puts &#39;hola mundo&#39;
end</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We have re-resolved the file automatically using the <code class="literal">rerere</code> cached resolution.
You can now add and continue the rebase to complete it.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add hello.rb

</figure>
<p>So, if you do a lot of re-merges, or want to keep a topic branch up to date with your master branch without a ton of merges, or you rebase often, you can turn on <code class="literal">rerere</code> to help your life out a bit.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Debugging with Git">
<h2 id="_debugging_with_git">Debugging with Git</h2>
<p>Git also provides a couple of tools to help you debug issues in your projects.
Because Git is designed to work with nearly any type of project, these tools are pretty generic, but they can often help you hunt for a bug or culprit when things go wrong.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="File Annotation">
<h3 id="r_file_annotation">File Annotation</h3>
<p>If you track down a bug in your code and want to know when it was introduced and why, file annotation is often your best tool.
It shows you what commit was the last to modify each line of any file.
So, if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with <code class="literal">git blame</code> to see when each line of the method was last edited and by whom.
This example uses the <code class="literal">-L</code> option to limit the output to lines 12 through 22:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git blame -L 12,22 simplegit.rb

42cf2861 (Magnus Chacon 2008-04-13 10:45:01 -0700 22)  end</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Notice that the first field is the partial SHA-1 of the commit that last modified that line.
The next two fields are values extracted from that commit–the author name and the authored date of that commit – so you can easily see who modified that line and when.
After that come the line number and the content of the file.
Also note the <code class="literal">^4832fe2</code> commit lines, which designate that those lines were in this file’s original commit.
That commit is when this file was first added to this project, and those lines have been unchanged since.
This is a tad confusing, because now you’ve seen at least three different ways that Git uses the <code class="literal">^</code> to modify a commit SHA-1, but that is what it means here.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about Git is that it doesn’t track file renames explicitly.
It records the snapshots and then tries to figure out what was renamed implicitly, after the fact.
One of the interesting features of this is that you can ask it to figure out all sorts of code movement as well.
If you pass <code class="literal">-C</code> to <code class="literal">git blame</code>, Git analyzes the file you’re annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere.
For example, say you are refactoring a file named <code class="literal">GITServerHandler.m</code> into multiple files, one of which is <code class="literal">GITPackUpload.m</code>.
By blaming <code class="literal">GITPackUpload.m</code> with the <code class="literal">-C</code> option, you can see where sections of the code originally came from:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git blame -C -L 141,153 GITPackUpload.m

<p>This is really useful.
Normally, you get as the original commit the commit where you copied the code over, because that is the first time you touched those lines in this file.
Git tells you the original commit where you wrote those lines, even if it was in another file.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Binary Search">
<h3 id="r_binary_search">Binary Search</h3>
<p>Annotating a file helps if you know where the issue is to begin with.
If you don’t know what is breaking, and there have been dozens or hundreds of commits since the last state where you know the code worked, you’ll likely turn to <code class="literal">git bisect</code> for help.
The <code class="literal">bisect</code> command does a binary search through your commit history to help you identify as quickly as possible which commit introduced an issue.</p>
<p>Let’s say you just pushed out a release of your code to a production environment, you’re getting bug reports about something that wasn’t happening in your development environment, and you can’t imagine why the code is doing that.
You go back to your code, and it turns out you can reproduce the issue, but you can’t figure out what is going wrong.
You can bisect the code to find out.
First you run <code class="literal">git bisect start</code> to get things going, and then you use <code class="literal">git bisect bad</code> to tell the system that the current commit you’re on is broken.
Then, you must tell bisect when the last known good state was, using <code class="literal">git bisect good [good_commit]</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bisect start

</figure>
<p>Git figured out that about 12 commits came between the commit you marked as the last good commit (v1.0) and the current bad version, and it checked out the middle one for you.
At this point, you can run your test to see if the issue exists as of this commit.
If it does, then it was introduced sometime before this middle commit; if it doesn’t, then the problem was introduced sometime after the middle commit.
It turns out there is no issue here, and you tell Git that by typing <code class="literal">git bisect good</code> and continue your journey:</p>
<figure class="listing">

</figure>
<p>Now you’re on another commit, halfway between the one you just tested and your bad commit.
You run your test again and find that this commit is broken, so you tell Git that with <code class="literal">git bisect bad</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">

<p>This commit is fine, and now Git has all the information it needs to determine where the issue was introduced.
It tells you the SHA-1 of the first bad commit and show some of the commit information and which files were modified in that commit so you can figure out what happened that may have introduced this bug:</p>

<p>When you’re finished, you should run <code class="literal">git bisect reset</code> to reset your HEAD to where you were before you started, or you’ll end up in a weird state:</p>

<p>This is a powerful tool that can help you check hundreds of commits for an introduced bug in minutes.
In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is bad, you can fully automate <code class="literal">git bisect</code>.
First, you again tell it the scope of the bisect by providing the known bad and good commits.
You can do this by listing them with the <code class="literal">bisect start</code> command if you want, listing the known bad commit first and the known good commit second:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bisect start HEAD v1.0
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bisect run test-error.sh</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Doing so automatically runs <code class="literal">test-error.sh</code> on each checked-out commit until Git finds the first broken commit.
You can also run something like <code class="literal">make</code> or <code class="literal">make tests</code> or whatever you have that runs automated tests for you.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Submodules">
<h2 id="r_git_submodules">Submodules</h2>
<p>It often happens that while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it.
Perhaps it’s a library that a third party developed or that you’re developing separately and using in multiple parent projects.
A common issue arises in these scenarios: you want to be able to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.</p>
<p>Here’s an example.
Suppose you’re developing a web site and creating Atom feeds.
Instead of writing your own Atom-generating code, you decide to use a library.
You’re likely to have to either include this code from a shared library like a CPAN install or Ruby gem, or copy the source code into your own project tree.
The issue with including the library is that it’s difficult to customize the library in any way and often more difficult to deploy it, because you need to make sure every client has that library available.
The issue with vendoring the code into your own project is that any custom changes you make are difficult to merge when upstream changes become available.</p>
<p>Git addresses this issue using submodules.
Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.
This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Starting with Submodules">
<h3 id="r_starting_submodules">Starting with Submodules</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ll walk through developing a simple project that has been split up into a main project and a few sub-projects.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by adding an existing Git repository as a submodule of the repository that we&#8217;re working on.
To add a new submodule you use the <code class="literal">git submodule add</code> command with the absolute or relative URL of the project you would like to start tracking.
In this example, we&#8217;ll add a library called “DbConnector”.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
Cloning into &#39;DbConnector&#39;...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>By default, submodules will add the subproject into a directory named the same as the repository, in this case “DbConnector”.
You can add a different path at the end of the command if you want it to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you run <code class="literal">git status</code> at this point, you&#8217;ll notice a few things.</p>
<figure class="listing">

	new file:   DbConnector</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>First you should notice the new <code class="literal">.gitmodules</code> file.
This is a configuration file that stores the mapping between the project’s URL and the local subdirectory you’ve pulled it into:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-ini"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">[submodule &quot;DbConnector&quot;]</span>
	path = <span style="font-style: italic">DbConnector</span>
<span style="font-style: italic">	url = https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you have multiple submodules, you’ll have multiple entries in this file.
It’s important to note that this file is version-controlled with your other files, like your <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file.
It’s pushed and pulled with the rest of your project.
This is how other people who clone this project know where to get the submodule projects from.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="筆記" epub:type="note">
<div class="content">
<p>Since the URL in the .gitmodules file is what other people will first try to clone/fetch from, make sure to use a URL that they can access if possible.
For example, if you use a different URL to push to than others would to pull from, use the one that others have access to.
You can overwrite this value locally with <code class="literal">git config submodule.DbConnector.url PRIVATE_URL</code> for your own use.
When applicable, a relative URL can be helpful.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>The other listing in the <code class="literal">git status</code> output is the project folder entry.
If you run <code class="literal">git diff</code> on that, you see something interesting:</p>

<p>Although <code class="literal">DbConnector</code> is a subdirectory in your working directory, Git sees it as a submodule and doesn’t track its contents when you’re not in that directory.

<p>The <code class="literal">DbConnector</code> directory is there, but empty.
You must run two commands: <code class="literal">git submodule init</code> to initialize your local configuration file, and <code class="literal">git submodule update</code> to fetch all the data from that project and check out the appropriate commit listed in your superproject:</p>
<figure class="listing">

<h3 id="_working_on_a_project_with_submodules">Working on a Project with Submodules</h3>
<p>Now we have a copy of a project with submodules in it and will collaborate with our teammates on both the main project and the submodule project.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Pulling in Upstream Changes">
<h4 id="_pulling_in_upstream_changes">Pulling in Upstream Changes</h4>
<p>The simplest model of using submodules in a project would be if you were simply consuming a subproject and wanted to get updates from it from time to time but were not actually modifying anything in your checkout.
Let&#8217;s walk through a simple example there.</p>
<p>If you want to check for new work in a submodule, you can go into the directory and run <code class="literal">git fetch</code> and <code class="literal">git merge</code> the upstream branch to update the local code.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git fetch
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
   c3f01dc..d0354fc  master     -&gt; origin/master

Fast-forward

 src/db.c           | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now if you go back into the main project and run <code class="literal">git diff --submodule</code> you can see that the submodule was updated and get a list of commits that were added to it.
If you don&#8217;t want to type <code class="literal">--submodule</code> every time you run <code class="literal">git diff</code>, you can set it as the default format by setting the <code class="literal">diff.submodule</code> config value to “log”.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global diff.submodule log
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff
Submodule DbConnector c3f01dc..d0354fc:
  &gt; more efficient db routine
  &gt; better connection routine</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you commit at this point then you will lock the submodule into having the new code when other people update.</p>
<p>There is an easier way to do this as well, if you prefer to not manually fetch and merge in the subdirectory.
If you run <code class="literal">git submodule update --remote</code>, Git will go into your submodules and fetch and update for you.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git submodule update --remote DbConnector
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.

</figure>
<p>This command will by default assume that you want to update the checkout to the <code class="literal">master</code> branch of the submodule repository.
You can, however, set this to something different if you want.
For example, if you want to have the DbConnector submodule track that repository&#8217;s “stable” branch, you can set it in either your <code class="literal">.gitmodules</code> file (so everyone else also tracks it), or just in your local <code class="literal">.git/config</code> file.
Let&#8217;s set it in the <code class="literal">.gitmodules</code> file:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config -f .gitmodules submodule.DbConnector.branch stable

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git submodule update --remote

</figure>
<p>If you leave off the <code class="literal">-f .gitmodules</code> it will only make the change for you, but it probably makes more sense to track that information with the repository so everyone else does as well.</p>
<p>When we run <code class="literal">git status</code> at this point, Git will show us that we have “new commits” on the submodule.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status

Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you set the configuration setting <code class="literal">status.submodulesummary</code>, Git will also show you a short summary of changes to your submodules:</p>
<figure class="listing">

Submodules changed but not updated:

</figure>
<p>At this point if you run <code class="literal">git diff</code> we can see both that we have modified our <code class="literal">.gitmodules</code> file and also that there are a number of commits that we&#8217;ve pulled down and are ready to commit to our submodule project.</p>

<p>Git will by default try to update <strong>all</strong> of your submodules when you run <code class="literal">git submodule update --remote</code> so if you have a lot of them, you may want to pass the name of just the submodule you want to try to update.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Working on a Submodule">
<h4 id="_working_on_a_submodule">Working on a Submodule</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s quite likely that if you&#8217;re using submodules, you&#8217;re doing so because you really want to work on the code in the submodule at the same time as you&#8217;re working on the code in the main project (or across several submodules).
Otherwise you would probably instead be using a simpler dependency management system (such as Maven or Rubygems).</p>
<p>So now let&#8217;s go through an example of making changes to the submodule at the same time as the main project and committing and publishing those changes at the same time.</p>
<p>So far, when we&#8217;ve run the <code class="literal">git submodule update</code> command to fetch changes from the submodule repositories, Git would get the changes and update the files in the subdirectory but will leave the sub-repository in what&#8217;s called a “detached HEAD” state.
This means that there is no local working branch (like “master”, for example) tracking changes.
With no working branch tracking changes, that means even if you commit changes to the submodule, those changes will quite possibly be lost the next time you run <code class="literal">git submodule update</code>. You have to do some extra steps if you want changes in a submodule to be tracked.</p>
<p>In order to set up your submodule to be easier to go in and hack on, you need do two things.
You need to go into each submodule and check out a branch to work on.
Then you need to tell Git what to do if you have made changes and then <code class="literal">git submodule update --remote</code> pulls in new work from upstream.
The options are that you can merge them into your local work, or you can try to rebase your local work on top of the new changes.</p>
<p>First of all, let&#8217;s go into our submodule directory and check out a branch.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout stable
Switched to branch &#39;stable&#39;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Let&#8217;s try it with the “merge” option.
To specify it manually, we can just add the <code class="literal">--merge</code> option to our <code class="literal">update</code> call.
Here we&#8217;ll see that there was a change on the server for this submodule and it gets merged in.</p>

to push them to a remote.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, it also gives us some helpful advice on what we might want to do next.
The simple option is to go into each submodule and manually push to the remotes to make sure they&#8217;re externally available and then try this push again.</p>
<p>The other option is to use the “on-demand” value, which will try to do this for you.</p>

<section class="sect3" title="Merging Submodule Changes">
<h4 id="_merging_submodule_changes">Merging Submodule Changes</h4>
<p>If you change a submodule reference at the same time as someone else, you may run into some problems.
That is, if the submodule histories have diverged and are committed to diverging branches in a superproject, it may take a bit of work for you to fix.</p>
<p>If one of the commits is a direct ancestor of the other (a fast-forward merge), then Git will simply choose the latter for the merge, so that works fine.</p>
<p>Git will not attempt even a trivial merge for you, however.
If the submodule commits diverge and need to be merged, you will get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git pull

Fetching submodule DbConnector
warning: Failed to merge submodule DbConnector (merge following commits not found)
Auto-merging DbConnector
CONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in DbConnector
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>So basically what has happened here is that Git has figured out that the two branches record points in the submodule&#8217;s history that are divergent and need to be merged.
It explains it as “merge following commits not found”, which is confusing but we&#8217;ll explain why that is in a bit.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, you need to figure out what state the submodule should be in.
Strangely, Git doesn&#8217;t really give you much information to help out here, not even the SHA-1s of the commits of both sides of the history.
Fortunately, it&#8217;s simple to figure out.
If you run <code class="literal">git diff</code> you can get the SHA-1s of the commits recorded in both branches you were trying to merge.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git diff
diff --cc DbConnector
index eb41d76,c771610..0000000
--- a/DbConnector
+++ b/DbConnector</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>So, in this case, <code class="literal">eb41d76</code> is the commit in our submodule that <strong>we</strong> had and <code class="literal">c771610</code> is the commit that upstream had.
If we go into our submodule directory, it should already be on <code class="literal">eb41d76</code> as the merge would not have touched it.
If for whatever reason it&#8217;s not, you can simply create and checkout a branch pointing to it.</p>
<p>What is important is the SHA-1 of the commit from the other side.
This is what you&#8217;ll have to merge in and resolve.
You can either just try the merge with the SHA-1 directly, or you can create a branch for it and then try to merge that in.
We would suggest the latter, even if only to make a nicer merge commit message.</p>
<p>So, we will go into our submodule directory, create a branch based on that second SHA-1 from <code class="literal">git diff</code> and manually merge.</p>

<p>It can be a bit confusing, but it&#8217;s really not very hard.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is another case that Git handles.
If a merge commit exists in the submodule directory that contains <strong>both</strong> commits in its history, Git will suggest it to you as a possible solution.
It sees that at some point in the submodule project, someone merged branches containing these two commits, so maybe you&#8217;ll want that one.</p>
<p>This is why the error message from before was “merge following commits not found”, because it could not do <strong>this</strong>.
It&#8217;s confusing because who would expect it to <strong>try</strong> to do this?</p>
<p>If it does find a single acceptable merge commit, you&#8217;ll see something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">

<p>There are a few things you can do to make working with submodules a little easier.</p>
<section class="sect3" title="Submodule Foreach">
<h4 id="_submodule_foreach">Submodule Foreach</h4>
<p>There is a <code class="literal">foreach</code> submodule command to run some arbitrary command in each submodule.
This can be really helpful if you have a number of submodules in the same project.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say we want to start a new feature or do a bugfix and we have work going on in several submodules.
We can easily stash all the work in all our submodules.</p>

One really useful thing you can do is produce a nice unified diff of what is changed in your main project and all your subprojects as well.</p>

<p>Here we can see that we&#8217;re defining a function in a submodule and calling it in the main project.
This is obviously a simplified example, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how this may be useful.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect3" title="Useful Aliases">
<h4 id="_useful_aliases">Useful Aliases</h4>
<p>You may want to set up some aliases for some of these commands as they can be quite long and you can&#8217;t set configuration options for most of them to make them defaults.
We covered setting up Git aliases in <a id="xref--ch02-git-basics--r_git_aliases" href="ch02-git-basics.xhtml#r_git_aliases" class="xref">Git Aliases</a>, but here is an example of what you may want to set up if you plan on working with submodules in Git a lot.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config alias.sdiff <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;!&#39;&quot;git diff &amp;&amp; git submodule foreach &#39;git diff&#39;&quot;</span>

</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Issues with Submodules">
<h3 id="_issues_with_submodules">Issues with Submodules</h3>
<p>Using submodules isn’t without hiccups, however.</p>
<p>For instance switching branches with submodules in them can also be tricky.
If you create a new branch, add a submodule there, and then switch back to a branch without that submodule, you still have the submodule directory as an untracked directory:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout -b add-crypto

</figure>
<p>Removing the directory isn&#8217;t difficult, but it can be a bit confusing to have that in there.
If you do remove it and then switch back to the branch that has that submodule, you will need to run <code class="literal">submodule update --init</code> to repopulate it.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clean -fdx

</figure>
<p>Again, not really very difficult, but it can be a little confusing.</p>
<p>The other main caveat that many people run into involves switching from subdirectories to submodules.
If you’ve been tracking files in your project and you want to move them out into a submodule, you must be careful or Git will get angry at you.
Assume that you have files in a subdirectory of your project, and you want to switch it to a submodule.
If you delete the subdirectory and then run <code class="literal">submodule add</code>, Git yells at you:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> rm -Rf CryptoLibrary/
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
&#39;CryptoLibrary&#39; already exists in the index</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You have to unstage the <code class="literal">CryptoLibrary</code> directory first.
Then you can add the submodule:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rm -r CryptoLibrary
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
Cloning into &#39;CryptoLibrary&#39;...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now suppose you did that in a branch.
If you try to switch back to a branch where those files are still in the actual tree rather than a submodule – you get this error:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout master
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
  CryptoLibrary/Makefile
  CryptoLibrary/includes/crypto.h
  ...
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can force it to switch with <code class="literal">checkout -f</code>, but be careful that you don&#8217;t have unsaved changes in there as they could be overwritten with that command.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout -f master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch &#39;master&#39;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Then, when you switch back, you get an empty <code class="literal">CryptoLibrary</code> directory for some reason and <code class="literal">git submodule update</code> may not fix it either.
You may need to go into your submodule directory and run a <code class="literal">git checkout .</code> to get all your files back.
You could run this in a <code class="literal">submodule foreach</code> script to run it for multiple submodules.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that submodules these days keep all their Git data in the top project&#8217;s <code class="literal">.git</code> directory, so unlike much older versions of Git, destroying a submodule directory won&#8217;t lose any commits or branches that you had.</p>
<p>With these tools, submodules can be a fairly simple and effective method for developing on several related but still separate projects simultaneously.</p>

</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Bundling">
<h2 id="r_bundling">Bundling</h2>
<p>Though we&#8217;ve covered the common ways to transfer Git data over a network (HTTP, SSH, etc), there is actually one more way to do so that is not commonly used but can actually be quite useful.</p>
<p>Git is capable of “bundling” its data into a single file.
This can be useful in various scenarios.
Maybe your network is down and you want to send changes to your co-workers.
Perhaps you&#8217;re working somewhere offsite and don&#8217;t have access to the local network for security reasons.
Maybe your wireless/ethernet card just broke.
Maybe you don&#8217;t have access to a shared server for the moment, you want to email someone updates and you don&#8217;t want to transfer 40 commits via <code class="literal">format-patch</code>.</p>
<p>This is where the <code class="literal">git bundle</code> command can be helpful.
The <code class="literal">bundle</code> command will package up everything that would normally be pushed over the wire with a <code class="literal">git push</code> command into a binary file that you can email to someone or put on a flash drive, then unbundle into another repository.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see a simple example.
Let&#8217;s say you have a repository with two commits:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log
commit 9a466c572fe88b195efd356c3f2bbeccdb504102

Date:   Wed Mar 10 07:34:01 2010 -0800

    first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you want to send that repository to someone and you don&#8217;t have access to a repository to push to, or simply don&#8217;t want to set one up, you can bundle it with <code class="literal">git bundle create</code>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD master
Counting objects: 6, done.

Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 441 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now you have a file named <code class="literal">repo.bundle</code> that has all the data needed to re-create the repository&#8217;s <code class="literal">master</code> branch.
With the <code class="literal">bundle</code> command you need to list out every reference or specific range of commits that you want to be included.
If you intend for this to be cloned somewhere else, you should add HEAD as a reference as well as we&#8217;ve done here.</p>
<p>You can email this <code class="literal">repo.bundle</code> file to someone else, or put it on a USB drive and walk it over.</p>
<p>On the other side, say you are sent this <code class="literal">repo.bundle</code> file and want to work on the project.
You can clone from the binary file into a directory, much like you would from a URL.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clone repo.bundle repo

9a466c5 second commit
b1ec324 first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you don&#8217;t include HEAD in the references, you have to also specify <code class="literal">-b master</code> or whatever branch is included because otherwise it won&#8217;t know what branch to check out.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say you do three commits on it and want to send the new commits back via a bundle on a USB stick or email.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline

7011d3d third commit - second repo
9a466c5 second commit
b1ec324 first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>First we need to determine the range of commits we want to include in the bundle.
Unlike the network protocols which figure out the minimum set of data to transfer over the network for us, we&#8217;ll have to figure this out manually.
 Now, you could just do the same thing and bundle the entire repository, which will work, but it&#8217;s better to just bundle up the difference - just the three commits we just made locally.</p>
<p>In order to do that, you&#8217;ll have to calculate the difference.
As we described in <a id="xref-r_commit_ranges" href="#r_commit_ranges" class="xref">Commit Ranges</a>, you can specify a range of commits in a number of ways.
To get the three commits that we have in our master branch that weren&#8217;t in the branch we originally cloned, we can use something like <code class="literal">origin/master..master</code> or <code class="literal">master ^origin/master</code>.
You can test that with the <code class="literal">log</code> command.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline master ^origin/master

7011d3d third commit - second repo</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>So now that we have the list of commits we want to include in the bundle, let&#8217;s bundle them up.
We do that with the <code class="literal">git bundle create</code> command, giving it a filename we want our bundle to be and the range of commits we want to go into it.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bundle create commits.bundle master ^9a466c5

Delta compression using up to 2 threads.

Total 9 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now we have a <code class="literal">commits.bundle</code> file in our directory.
If we take that and send it to our partner, she can then import it into the original repository, even if more work has been done there in the meantime.</p>
<p>When she gets the bundle, she can inspect it to see what it contains before she imports it into her repository.
The first command is the <code class="literal">bundle verify</code> command that will make sure the file is actually a valid Git bundle and that you have all the necessary ancestors to reconstitute it properly.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bundle verify ../commits.bundle
The bundle contains 1 ref
71b84daaf49abed142a373b6e5c59a22dc6560dc refs/heads/master
The bundle requires these 1 ref
9a466c572fe88b195efd356c3f2bbeccdb504102 second commit
../commits.bundle is okay</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If the bundler had created a bundle of just the last two commits they had done, rather than all three, the original repository would not be able to import it, since it is missing requisite history.
The <code class="literal">verify</code> command would have looked like this instead:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bundle verify ../commits-bad.bundle
error: Repository lacks these prerequisite commits:
error: 7011d3d8fc200abe0ad561c011c3852a4b7bbe95 third commit - second repo</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>However, our first bundle is valid, so we can fetch in commits from it.
If you want to see what branches are in the bundle that can be imported, there is also a command to just list the heads:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git bundle list-heads ../commits.bundle
71b84daaf49abed142a373b6e5c59a22dc6560dc refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">verify</code> sub-command will tell you the heads as well.
The point is to see what can be pulled in, so you can use the <code class="literal">fetch</code> or <code class="literal">pull</code> commands to import commits from this bundle.
Here we&#8217;ll fetch the <em>master</em> branch of the bundle to a branch named <em>other-master</em> in our repository:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git fetch ../commits.bundle master:other-master
From ../commits.bundle
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; other-master</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now we can see that we have the imported commits on the <em>other-master</em> branch as well as any commits we&#8217;ve done in the meantime in our own <em>master</em> branch.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
* 8255d41 (HEAD, master) third commit - first repo

| * 7011d3d third commit - second repo
|/
* 9a466c5 second commit
* b1ec324 first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>So, <code class="literal">git bundle</code> can be really useful for sharing or doing network-type operations when you don&#8217;t have the proper network or shared repository to do so.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Replace">
<h2 id="r_replace">Replace</h2>
<p>Git&#8217;s objects are unchangeable, but it does provide an interesting way to pretend to replace objects in its database with other objects.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">replace</code> command lets you specify an object in Git and say "every time you see this, pretend it&#8217;s this other thing".
This is most commonly useful for replacing one commit in your history with another one.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you have a huge code history and want to split your repository into one short history for new developers and one much longer and larger history for people interested in data mining.
You can graft one history onto the other by `replace`ing the earliest commit in the new line with the latest commit on the older one.
This is nice because it means that you don&#8217;t actually have to rewrite every commit in the new history, as you would normally have to do to join them together (because the parentage affects the SHA-1s).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try this out.
Let&#8217;s take an existing repository, split it into two repositories, one recent and one historical, and then we&#8217;ll see how we can recombine them without modifying the recent repositories SHA-1 values via <code class="literal">replace</code>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll use a simple repository with five simple commits:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline
ef989d8 fifth commit
c6e1e95 fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We want to break this up into two lines of history.
One line goes from commit one to commit four - that will be the historical one.
The second line will just be commits four and five - that will be the recent history.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/replace1.png" alt="replace1"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Well, creating the historical history is easy, we can just put a branch in the history and then push that branch to the master branch of a new remote repository.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git branch history c6e1e95
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline --decorate
ef989d8 (HEAD, master) fifth commit
c6e1e95 (history) fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/replace2.png" alt="replace2"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Now we can push the new <code class="literal">history</code> branch to the <code class="literal">master</code> branch of our new repository:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote add project-history https://github.com/schacon/project-history
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git push project-history history:master
Counting objects: 12, done.

Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.
To git@github.com:schacon/project-history.git
 * [new branch]      history -&gt; master</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>OK, so our history is published.
Now the harder part is truncating our recent history down so it&#8217;s smaller.
We need an overlap so we can replace a commit in one with an equivalent commit in the other, so we&#8217;re going to truncate this to just commits four and five (so commit four overlaps).</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline --decorate
ef989d8 (HEAD, master) fifth commit
c6e1e95 (history) fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>It&#8217;s useful in this case to create a base commit that has instructions on how to expand the history, so other developers know what to do if they hit the first commit in the truncated history and need more.
So, what we&#8217;re going to do is create an initial commit object as our base point with instructions, then rebase the remaining commits (four and five) on top of it.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to choose a point to split at, which for us is the third commit, which is <code class="literal">9c68fdc</code> in SHA-speak.
So, our base commit will be based off of that tree.
We can create our base commit using the <code class="literal">commit-tree</code> command, which just takes a tree and will give us a brand new, parentless commit object SHA-1 back.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> echo <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;get history from blah blah blah&#39;</span> | git commit-tree 9c68fdc^{tree}

</figure>
<aside class="admonition note" title="筆記" epub:type="note">
<div class="content">
<p>The <code class="literal">commit-tree</code> command is one of a set of commands that are commonly referred to as <em>plumbing</em> commands.
These are commands that are not generally meant to be used directly, but instead are used by <strong>other</strong> Git commands to do smaller jobs.
On occasions when we&#8217;re doing weirder things like this, they allow us to do really low-level things but are not meant for daily use.
You can read more about plumbing commands in <a id="xref--ch10-git-internals--r_plumbing_porcelain" href="ch10-git-internals.xhtml#r_plumbing_porcelain" class="xref">Plumbing and Porcelain</a></p>

<figure class="image">
<div class="content">

</div>
</figure>
<p>OK, so now that we have a base commit, we can rebase the rest of our history on top of that with <code class="literal">git rebase --onto</code>.
The <code class="literal">--onto</code> argument will be the SHA-1 we just got back from <code class="literal">commit-tree</code> and the rebase point will be the third commit (the parent of the first commit we want to keep, <code class="literal">9c68fdc</code>):</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rebase --onto 622e88 9c68fdc

</figure>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/replace4.png" alt="replace4"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>OK, so now we&#8217;ve re-written our recent history on top of a throw away base commit that now has instructions in it on how to reconstitute the entire history if we wanted to.
We can push that new history to a new project and now when people clone that repository, they will only see the most recent two commits and then a base commit with instructions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now switch roles to someone cloning the project for the first time who wants the entire history.
To get the history data after cloning this truncated repository, one would have to add a second remote for the historical repository and fetch:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clone https://github.com/schacon/project
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cd project

e146b5f fifth commit
81a708d fourth commit

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote add project-history https://github.com/schacon/project-history
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git fetch project-history
From https://github.com/schacon/project-history
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; project-history/master</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now the collaborator would have their recent commits in the <code class="literal">master</code> branch and the historical commits in the <code class="literal">project-history/master</code> branch.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline master
e146b5f fifth commit
81a708d fourth commit
622e88e get history from blah blah blah

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline project-history/master
c6e1e95 fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>To combine them, you can simply call <code class="literal">git replace</code> with the commit you want to replace and then the commit you want to replace it with.
So we want to replace the "fourth" commit in the master branch with the "fourth" commit in the <code class="literal">project-history/master</code> branch:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git replace 81a708d c6e1e95</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now, if you look at the history of the <code class="literal">master</code> branch, it appears to look like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --oneline master
e146b5f fifth commit
81a708d fourth commit
9c68fdc third commit
945704c second commit
c1822cf first commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Cool, right?  Without having to change all the SHA-1s upstream, we were able to replace one commit in our history with an entirely different commit and all the normal tools (<code class="literal">bisect</code>, <code class="literal">blame</code>, etc) will work how we would expect them to.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/replace5.png" alt="replace5"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Interestingly, it still shows <code class="literal">81a708d</code> as the SHA-1, even though it&#8217;s actually using the <code class="literal">c6e1e95</code> commit data that we replaced it with.
Even if you run a command like <code class="literal">cat-file</code>, it will show you the replaced data:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git cat-file -p 81a708d
tree 7bc544cf438903b65ca9104a1e30345eee6c083d

committer Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1268712581 -0700

fourth commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Remember that the actual parent of <code class="literal">81a708d</code> was our placeholder commit (<code class="literal">622e88e</code>), not <code class="literal">9c68fdce</code> as it states here.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that this data is kept in our references:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git <span style="font-weight: bold">for</span>-each-ref
e146b5f14e79d4935160c0e83fb9ebe526b8da0d commit	refs/heads/master

</figure>
<p>This means that it&#8217;s easy to share our replacement with others, because we can push this to our server and other people can easily download it.
This is not that helpful in the history grafting scenario we&#8217;ve gone over here (since everyone would be downloading both histories anyhow, so why separate them?) but it can be useful in other circumstances.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Credential Storage">
<h2 id="r_credential_caching">Credential Storage</h2>
<p>

If you use the SSH transport for connecting to remotes, it&#8217;s possible for you to have a key without a passphrase, which allows you to securely transfer data without typing in your username and password.
However, this isn&#8217;t possible with the HTTP protocols – every connection needs a username and password.
This gets even harder for systems with two-factor authentication, where the token you use for a password is randomly generated and unpronounceable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Git has a credentials system that can help with this.
Git has a few options provided in the box:</p>
<div class="itemized-list">
<ul>
<li>
<span class="principal">The default is not to cache at all.
Every connection will prompt you for your username and password.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">The “cache” mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of time.
None of the passwords are ever stored on disk, and they are purged from the cache after 15 minutes.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">The “store” mode saves the credentials to a plain-text file on disk, and they never expire.
This means that until you change your password for the Git host, you won&#8217;t ever have to type in your credentials again.
The downside of this approach is that your passwords are stored in cleartext in a plain file in your home directory.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">If you&#8217;re using a Mac, Git comes with an “osxkeychain” mode, which caches credentials in the secure keychain that&#8217;s attached to your system account.
This method stores the credentials on disk, and they never expire, but they&#8217;re encrypted with the same system that stores HTTPS certificates and Safari auto-fills.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">If you&#8217;re using Windows, you can install a helper called “wincred.”
This is similar to the “osxkeychain” helper described above, but uses the Windows Credential Store to control sensitive information.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can choose one of these methods by setting a Git configuration value:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global credential.helper cache</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Some of these helpers have options.
The “store” helper can take a <code class="literal">--file &lt;path&gt;</code> argument, which customizes where the plain-text file is saved (the default is <code class="literal">~/.git-credentials</code>).
The “cache” helper accepts the <code class="literal">--timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</code> option, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept running (the default is “900”, or 15 minutes).
Here&#8217;s an example of how you&#8217;d configure the “store” helper with a custom file name:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global credential.helper <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;store --file ~/.my-credentials&#39;</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Git even allows you to configure several helpers.
When looking for credentials for a particular host, Git will query them in order, and stop after the first answer is provided.
When saving credentials, Git will send the username and password to <strong>all</strong> of the helpers in the list, and they can choose what to do with them.
Here&#8217;s what a <code class="literal">.gitconfig</code> would look like if you had a credentials file on a thumb drive, but wanted to use the in-memory cache to save some typing if the drive isn&#8217;t plugged in:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-ini"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">[credential]</span>
    helper = <span style="font-style: italic">store --file /mnt/thumbdrive/.git-credentials</span>
<span style="font-style: italic">    helper = cache --timeout 30000</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<section class="sect2" title="Under the Hood">
<h3 id="_under_the_hood">Under the Hood</h3>
<p>How does this all work?
Git&#8217;s root command for the credential-helper system is <code class="literal">git credential</code>, which takes a command as an argument, and then more input through stdin.</p>
<p>This might be easier to understand with an example.
Let&#8217;s say that a credential helper has been configured, and the helper has stored credentials for <code class="literal">mygithost</code>.
Here&#8217;s a session that uses the “fill” command, which is invoked when Git is trying to find credentials for a host:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git credential fill <i class="conum" data-value="1">①</i>
protocol=https <i class="conum" data-value="2">②</i>
host=mygithost
 <i class="conum" data-value="3">③</i>
protocol=https <i class="conum" data-value="4">④</i>
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git credential fill <i class="conum" data-value="5">⑤</i>
protocol=https
host=unknownhost

Username for &#39;https://unknownhost&#39;: bob
Password for &#39;https://bob@unknownhost&#39;:
protocol=https
host=unknownhost
username=bob
password=s3cre7</code></pre>
</figure>
<div class="callout-list">
<ol>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="1">①</i> This is the command line that initiates the interaction.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="2">②</i> Git-credential is then waiting for input on stdin.
We provide it with the things we know: the protocol and hostname.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="3">③</i> A blank line indicates that the input is complete, and the credential system should answer with what it knows.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="4">④</i> Git-credential then takes over, and writes to stdout with the bits of information it found.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="5">⑤</i> If credentials are not found, Git asks the user for the username and password, and provides them back to the invoking stdout (here they&#8217;re attached to the same console).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The credential system is actually invoking a program that&#8217;s separate from Git itself; which one and how depends on the <code class="literal">credential.helper</code> configuration value.
There are several forms it can take:</p>
<div class="table">
<div class="content">
<table class="table table-framed-topbot table-grid-rows" style="width: 100%">
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Configuration Value</th>
<th>Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><code class="literal">foo</code></p></td>
<td><p>Runs <code class="literal">git-credential-foo</code></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><code class="literal">foo -a --opt=bcd</code></p></td>
<td><p>Runs <code class="literal">git-credential-foo -a --opt=bcd</code></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><code class="literal">/absolute/path/foo -xyz</code></p></td>
<td><p>Runs <code class="literal">/absolute/path/foo -xyz</code></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><code class="literal">!f() { echo "password=s3cre7"; }; f</code></p></td>
<td><p>Code after <code class="literal">!</code> evaluated in shell</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>So the helpers described above are actually named <code class="literal">git-credential-cache</code>, <code class="literal">git-credential-store</code>, and so on, and we can configure them to take command-line arguments.
The general form for this is “git-credential-foo [args] &lt;action&gt;.”
The stdin/stdout protocol is the same as git-credential, but they use a slightly different set of actions:</p>
<div class="itemized-list">
<ul>
<li>
<span class="principal"><code class="literal">get</code> is a request for a username/password pair.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal"><code class="literal">store</code> is a request to save a set of credentials in this helper&#8217;s memory.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal"><code class="literal">erase</code> purge the credentials for the given properties from this helper&#8217;s memory.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For the <code class="literal">store</code> and <code class="literal">erase</code> actions, no response is required (Git ignores it anyway).
For the <code class="literal">get</code> action, however, Git is very interested in what the helper has to say.
If the helper doesn&#8217;t know anything useful, it can simply exit with no output, but if it does know, it should augment the provided information with the information it has stored.
The output is treated like a series of assignment statements; anything provided will replace what Git already knows.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the same example from above, but skipping git-credential and going straight for git-credential-store:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git credential-store --file ~/git.store store <i class="conum" data-value="1">①</i>

<p>It&#8217;s just a series of lines, each of which contains a credential-decorated URL.
The <code class="literal">osxkeychain</code> and <code class="literal">wincred</code> helpers use the native format of their backing stores, while <code class="literal">cache</code> uses its own in-memory format (which no other process can read).</p>

<p>Given that <code class="literal">git-credential-store</code> and friends are separate programs from Git, it&#8217;s not much of a leap to realize that <em>any</em> program can be a Git credential helper.
The helpers provided by Git cover many common use cases, but not all.
For example, let&#8217;s say your team has some credentials that are shared with the entire team, perhaps for deployment.
These are stored in a shared directory, but you don&#8217;t want to copy them to your own credential store, because they change often.
None of the existing helpers cover this case; let&#8217;s see what it would take to write our own.
There are several key features this program needs to have:</p>
<div class="ordered-list arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<span class="principal">The only action we need to pay attention to is <code class="literal">get</code>; <code class="literal">store</code> and <code class="literal">erase</code> are write operations, so we&#8217;ll just exit cleanly when they&#8217;re received.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">The file format of the shared-credential file is the same as that used by <code class="literal">git-credential-store</code>.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">The location of that file is fairly standard, but we should allow the user to pass a custom path just in case.</span>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Once again, we&#8217;ll write this extension in Ruby, but any language will work so long as Git can execute the finished product.
Here&#8217;s the full source code of our new credential helper:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-ruby"><code><span></span><span style="font-style: italic">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

    known[k] = v

        exit(0)
    <span style="font-weight: bold">end</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">end</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<div class="callout-list">
<ol>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="1">①</i> Here we parse the command-line options, allowing the user to specify the input file. The default is <code class="literal">~/.git-credentials</code>.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="2">②</i> This program only responds if the action is <code class="literal">get</code> and the backing-store file exists.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="3">③</i> This loop reads from stdin until the first blank line is reached.
The inputs are stored in the <code class="literal">known</code> hash for later reference.</li>
<li><i class="conum" data-value="4">④</i> This loop reads the contents of the storage file, looking for matches.
If the protocol and host from <code class="literal">known</code> match this line, the program prints the results to stdout and exits.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>We&#8217;ll save our helper as <code class="literal">git-credential-read-only</code>, put it somewhere in our <code class="literal">PATH</code> and mark it executable.
Here&#8217;s what an interactive session looks like:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git credential-read-only --file=/mnt/shared/creds get
protocol=https
host=mygithost

protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Since its name starts with “git-”, we can use the simple syntax for the configuration value:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global credential.helper <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;read-only --file /mnt/shared/creds&#39;</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, extending this system is pretty straightforward, and can solve some common problems for you and your team.</p>

<p class="last">You’ve seen a number of advanced tools that allow you to manipulate your commits and staging area more precisely.
When you notice issues, you should be able to easily figure out what commit introduced them, when, and by whom.
If you want to use subprojects in your project, you’ve learned how to accommodate those needs.
At this point, you should be able to do most of the things in Git that you’ll need on the command line day to day and feel comfortable doing so.</p>
