<p>The first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git.
This was my introduction to a style of making software that felt more natural than anything I had seen before.
I had been a developer for several years by then, but this was the right turn that sent me down a much more interesting path than the one I was on.</p>
<p>Now, years later, I&#8217;m a contributor to a major Git implementation, I&#8217;ve worked for the largest Git hosting company, and I&#8217;ve traveled the world teaching people about Git.
When Scott asked if I&#8217;d be interested in working on the second edition, I didn&#8217;t even have to think.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a great pleasure and privilege to work on this book.
I hope it helps you as much as it did me.</p>
