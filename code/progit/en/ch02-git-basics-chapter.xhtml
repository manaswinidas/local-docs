<p>If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it.
This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you&#8217;ll eventually spend your time doing with Git.
By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes.
We&#8217;ll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.</p>
</div>
<section class="sect1" title="Getting a Git Repository">
<h2 id="_getting_a_repo">Getting a Git Repository</h2>
<p>You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
<div class="ordered-list arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<span class="principal">You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">You can <em>clone</em> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.</span>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory">
<h3 id="_initializing_a_repository_in_an_existing_directory">Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</h3>
<p>If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project&#8217;s directory.
If you&#8217;ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which system you&#8217;re running:</p>
<p>for Linux:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cd /home/user/my_project</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>for macOS:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cd /Users/user/my_project</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>for Windows:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cd /c/user/my_project</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>and type:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git init</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This creates a new subdirectory named <code class="literal">.git</code> that contains all of your necessary repository files&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a Git repository skeleton.
At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.
(See <a id="xref--ch10-git-internals" href="ch10-git-internals.xhtml" class="xref">Git Internals</a> for more information about exactly what files are contained in the <code class="literal">.git</code> directory you just created.)</p>
<p>If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit.
You can accomplish that with a few <code class="literal">git add</code> commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a <code class="literal">git commit</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add *.c
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add LICENSE
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit -m <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;initial project version&#39;</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We&#8217;ll go over what these commands do in just a minute.
At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Cloning an Existing Repository">
<h3 id="_git_cloning">Cloning an Existing Repository</h3>
<p>If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, a project you&#8217;d like to contribute to&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the command you need is <code class="literal">git clone</code>.
If you&#8217;re familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you&#8217;ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout".
This is an important distinction&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has.
Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run <code class="literal">git clone</code>.
In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see <a id="xref--ch04-git-on-the-server--_getting_git_on_a_server" href="ch04-git-on-the-server.xhtml#_getting_git_on_a_server" class="xref">Getting Git on a Server</a> for more details).</p>
<p>You clone a repository with <code class="literal">git clone &lt;url&gt;</code>.
For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called <code class="literal">libgit2</code>, you can do so like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>That creates a directory named <code class="literal">libgit2</code>, initializes a <code class="literal">.git</code> directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version.
If you go into the new <code class="literal">libgit2</code> directory that was just created, you&#8217;ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.</p>
<p>If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than <code class="literal">libgit2</code>, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called <code class="literal">mylibgit</code>.</p>
<p>Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use.
The previous example uses the <code class="literal">https://</code> protocol, but you may also see <code class="literal">git://</code> or <code class="literal">user@server:path/to/repo.git</code>, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.
<a href="ch04-git-on-the-server.xhtml#_getting_git_on_a_server" class="xref">Getting Git on a Server</a> will introduce all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Recording Changes to the Repository">
<h2 id="_recording_changes_to_the_repository">Recording Changes to the Repository</h2>
<p>At this point, you should have a <em>bona fide</em> Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or <em>working copy</em> of all of its files in front of you.
Typically, you&#8217;ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.</p>
<p>Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: <em>tracked</em> or <em>untracked</em>.
Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged.
In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.</p>
<p>Untracked files are everything else&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.
When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven&#8217;t edited anything.</p>
<p>As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you&#8217;ve changed them since your last commit.
As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.</p>
<figure class="image">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/lifecycle.png" alt="The lifecycle of the status of your files."/>
</div>
<figcaption>Figure 1. The lifecycle of the status of your files.</figcaption>
</figure>
<section class="sect2" title="Checking the Status of Your Files">
<h3 id="_checking_status">Checking the Status of Your Files</h3>
<p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <code class="literal">git status</code> command.
If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified.
Git also doesn&#8217;t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here.
Finally, the command tells you which branch you&#8217;re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server.
For now, that branch is always “master”, which is the default; you won&#8217;t worry about it here.
<a id="xref--ch03-git-branching" href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml" class="xref">Git Branching</a> will go over branches and references in detail.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you add a new file to your project, a simple <code class="literal">README</code> file.
If the file didn&#8217;t exist before, and you run <code class="literal">git status</code>, you see your untracked file like so:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> echo <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;My Project&#39;</span> &gt; README
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

    README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that your new <code class="literal">README</code> file is untracked, because it&#8217;s under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output.
Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn&#8217;t have in the previous snapshot (commit); Git won&#8217;t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so.
It does this so you don&#8217;t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include.
You do want to start including <code class="literal">README</code>, so let&#8217;s start tracking the file.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Tracking New Files">
<h3 id="_tracking_files">Tracking New Files</h3>
<p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <code class="literal">git add</code>.
To begin tracking the <code class="literal">README</code> file, you can run this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your <code class="literal">README</code> file is now tracked and staged to be committed:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can tell that it&#8217;s staged because it&#8217;s under the “Changes to be committed” heading.
If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <code class="literal">git add</code> is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot.
You may recall that when you ran <code class="literal">git init</code> earlier, you then ran <code class="literal">git add &lt;files&gt;</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that was to begin tracking files in your directory.
The <code class="literal">git add</code> command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it&#8217;s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Staging Modified Files">
<h3 id="_staging_modified_files">Staging Modified Files</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s change a file that was already tracked.
If you change a previously tracked file called <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and then run your <code class="literal">git status</code> command again, you get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for commit”&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged.
To stage it, you run the <code class="literal">git add</code> command.
<code class="literal">git add</code> is a multipurpose command&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved.
It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”.
Let&#8217;s run <code class="literal">git add</code> now to stage the <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file, and then run <code class="literal">git status</code> again:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add CONTRIBUTING.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Both files are staged and will go into your next commit.
At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> before you commit it.
You open it again and make that change, and you&#8217;re ready to commit.
However, let&#8217;s run <code class="literal">git status</code> one more time:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> vim CONTRIBUTING.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>What the heck?
Now <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is listed as both staged <em>and</em> unstaged.
How is that possible?
It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the <code class="literal">git add</code> command.
If you commit now, the version of <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> as it was when you last ran the <code class="literal">git add</code> command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run <code class="literal">git commit</code>.
If you modify a file after you run <code class="literal">git add</code>, you have to run <code class="literal">git add</code> again to stage the latest version of the file:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add CONTRIBUTING.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Short Status">
<h3 id="_short_status">Short Status</h3>
<p>While the <code class="literal">git status</code> output is pretty comprehensive, it&#8217;s also quite wordy.
Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way.
If you run <code class="literal">git status -s</code> or <code class="literal">git status --short</code> you get a far more simplified output from the command:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status -s
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb
M  lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>New files that aren&#8217;t tracked have a <code class="literal">??</code> next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an <code class="literal">A</code>, modified files have an <code class="literal">M</code> and so on.
There are two columns to the output&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree.
So for example in that output, the <code class="literal">README</code> file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged, while the <code class="literal">lib/simplegit.rb</code> file is modified and staged.
The <code class="literal">Rakefile</code> was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Ignoring Files">
<h3 id="_ignoring">Ignoring Files</h3>
<p>Often, you&#8217;ll have a class of files that you don&#8217;t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked.
These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system.
In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named <code class="literal">.gitignore</code>.
Here is an example <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in “.o” or “.a”&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;object and archive files that may be the product of building your code.
The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (<code class="literal">~</code>), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files.
You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on.
Setting up a <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don&#8217;t accidentally commit files that you really don&#8217;t want in your Git repository.</p>
<p>The rules for the patterns you can put in the <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file are as follows:</p>
<div class="itemized-list">
<ul>
<li>
<span class="principal">Blank lines or lines starting with <code class="literal">#</code> are ignored.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">You can start patterns with a forward slash (<code class="literal">/</code>) to avoid recursivity.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">You can end patterns with a forward slash (<code class="literal">/</code>) to specify a directory.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (<code class="literal">!</code>).</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
An asterisk (<code class="literal">*</code>) matches zero or more characters; <code class="literal">[abc]</code> matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (<code class="literal">?</code>) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen (<code class="literal">[0-9]</code>) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9).
You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; <code class="literal">a/**/z</code> would match <code class="literal">a/z</code>, <code class="literal">a/b/z</code>, <code class="literal">a/b/c/z</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Here is another example <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-"><code># ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf</code></pre>
</figure>
<aside class="admonition tip" title="Tip" epub:type="help">

<p>GitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file examples for dozens of projects and languages at <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore" class="link">https://github.com/github/gitignore</a> if you want a starting point for your project.</p>

<p>In the simple case, a repository might have a single <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file in its root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository.
However, it is also possible to have additional <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> files in subdirectories.
The rules in these nested <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> files apply only to the files under the directory where they are located.

<section class="sect2" title="Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes">
<h3 id="_git_diff_staged">Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes</h3>

We&#8217;ll cover <code class="literal">git diff</code> in more detail later, but you&#8217;ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged?
And what have you staged that you are about to commit?
Although <code class="literal">git status</code> answers those questions very generally by listing the file names, <code class="literal">git diff</code> shows you the exact lines added and removed&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the patch, as it were.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you edit and stage the <code class="literal">README</code> file again and then edit the <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file without staging it.

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that <code class="literal">git diff</code> by itself doesn&#8217;t show all changes made since your last commit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only changes that are still unstaged.
If you&#8217;ve staged all of your changes, <code class="literal">git diff</code> will give you no output.</p>
<p>For another example, if you stage the <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file and then edit it, you can use <code class="literal">git diff</code> to see the changes in the file that are staged and the changes that are unstaged.

<section class="sect2" title="Committing Your Changes">
<h3 id="_committing_changes">Committing Your Changes</h3>
<p>Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes.
Remember that anything that is still unstaged&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;any files you have created or modified that you haven&#8217;t run <code class="literal">git add</code> on since you edited them&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;won&#8217;t go into this commit.
They will stay as modified files on your disk.
In this case, let&#8217;s say that the last time you ran <code class="literal">git status</code>, you saw that everything was staged, so you&#8217;re ready to commit your changes.
The simplest way to commit is to type <code class="literal">git commit</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Doing so launches your editor of choice.
(This is set by your shell&#8217;s <code class="literal">EDITOR</code> environment variable&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;usually vim or emacs, although you can configure it with whatever you want using the <code class="literal">git config --global core.editor</code> command as you saw in <a id="xref--ch01-getting-started" href="ch01-getting-started.xhtml" class="xref">Getting Started</a>).</p>
<p>The editor displays the following text (this example is a Vim screen):</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-"><code># Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.

".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" 9L, 283C</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that the default commit message contains the latest output of the <code class="literal">git status</code> command commented out and one empty line on top.
You can remove these comments and type your commit message, or you can leave them there to help you remember what you&#8217;re committing.
(For an even more explicit reminder of what you&#8217;ve modified, you can pass the <code class="literal">-v</code> option to <code class="literal">git commit</code>.
Doing so also puts the diff of your change in the editor so you can see exactly what changes you&#8217;re committing.)
When you exit the editor, Git creates your commit with that commit message (with the comments and diff stripped out).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the <code class="literal">commit</code> command by specifying it after a <code class="literal">-m</code> flag, like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit -m <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;Story 182: Fix benchmarks for speed&quot;</span>

 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve created your first commit!
You can see that the commit has given you some output about itself: which branch you committed to (<code class="literal">master</code>), what SHA-1 checksum the commit has (<code class="literal">463dc4f</code>), how many files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the commit.</p>
<p>Remember that the commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area.
Anything you didn&#8217;t stage is still sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history.
Every time you perform a commit, you&#8217;re recording a snapshot of your project that you can revert to or compare to later.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Skipping the Staging Area">
<h3 id="_skipping_the_staging_area">Skipping the Staging Area</h3>
<p>
Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow.
If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut.
Adding the <code class="literal">-a</code> option to the <code class="literal">git commit</code> command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the <code class="literal">git add</code> part:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit -a -m <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;added new benchmarks&#39;</span>
[master 83e38c7] added new benchmarks
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Notice how you don&#8217;t have to run <code class="literal">git add</code> on the <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file in this case before you commit.
That&#8217;s because the <code class="literal">-a</code> flag includes all changed files.
This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Removing Files">
<h3 id="_removing_files">Removing Files</h3>
<p>
To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit.
The <code class="literal">git rm</code> command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory so you don&#8217;t see it as an untracked file the next time around.</p>
<p>If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the “Changes not staged for commit” (that is, <em>unstaged</em>) area of your <code class="literal">git status</code> output:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> rm PROJECTS.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    PROJECTS.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Then, if you run <code class="literal">git rm</code>, it stages the file&#8217;s removal:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rm PROJECTS.md
rm &#39;PROJECTS.md&#39;
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    deleted:    PROJECTS.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked.
If you modified the file or had already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the <code class="literal">-f</code> option.
This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn&#8217;t yet been recorded in a snapshot and that can&#8217;t be recovered from Git.</p>
<p>Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging area.
In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore.
This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your <code class="literal">.gitignore</code> file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of <code class="literal">.a</code> compiled files.
To do this, use the <code class="literal">--cached</code> option:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rm --cached README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the <code class="literal">git rm</code> command.
That means you can do things such as:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rm log/<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">\*</span>.log</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Note the backslash (<code class="literal">\</code>) in front of the <code class="literal">*</code>.
This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell&#8217;s filename expansion.
This command removes all files that have the <code class="literal">.log</code> extension in the <code class="literal">log/</code> directory.
Or, you can do something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rm <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">\*</span>~</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command removes all files whose names end with a <code class="literal">~</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Moving Files">
<h3 id="_git_mv">Moving Files</h3>
<p>
Unlike many other VCS systems, Git doesn&#8217;t explicitly track file movement.
If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file.
However, Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;we&#8217;ll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.</p>
<p>Thus it&#8217;s a bit confusing that Git has a <code class="literal">mv</code> command.
If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git mv file_from file_to</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>and it works fine.
In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you&#8217;ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git mv README.md README
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>However, this is equivalent to running something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> mv README.md README
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git rm README.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Git figures out that it&#8217;s a rename implicitly, so it doesn&#8217;t matter if you rename a file that way or with the <code class="literal">mv</code> command.
The only real difference is that <code class="literal">git mv</code> is one command instead of three&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s a convenience function.
More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the add/rm later, before you commit.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Viewing the Commit History">
<h2 id="_viewing_history">Viewing the Commit History</h2>
<p>After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, you&#8217;ll probably want to look back to see what has happened.
The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the <code class="literal">git log</code> command.</p>
<p>These examples use a very simple project called “simplegit”.

<p>By default, with no arguments, <code class="literal">git log</code> lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order; that is, the most recent commits show up first.
As you can see, this command lists each commit with its SHA-1 checksum, the author&#8217;s name and email, the date written, and the commit message.</p>
<p>A huge number and variety of options to the <code class="literal">git log</code> command are available to show you exactly what you&#8217;re looking for.

<p>One of the more helpful options is <code class="literal">-p</code> or <code class="literal">--patch</code>, which shows the difference (the <em>patch</em> output) introduced in each commit.
You can also limit the number of log entries displayed, such as using <code class="literal">-2</code> to show only the last two entries.</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code class="literal">--stat</code> option prints below each commit entry a list of modified files, how many files were changed, and how many lines in those files were added and removed.
It also puts a summary of the information at the end.</p>
<p>Another really useful option is <code class="literal">--pretty</code>.
This option changes the log output to formats other than the default.
A few prebuilt options are available for you to use.
The <code class="literal">oneline</code> option prints each commit on a single line, which is useful if you&#8217;re looking at a lot of commits.
In addition, the <code class="literal">short</code>, <code class="literal">full</code>, and <code class="literal">fuller</code> options show the output in roughly the same format but with less or more information, respectively:</p>

<p>You may be wondering what the difference is between <em>author</em> and <em>committer</em>.
The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work.
So, if you send in a patch to a project and one of the core members applies the patch, both of you get credit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you as the author, and the core member as the committer.
We&#8217;ll cover this distinction a bit more in <a id="xref--ch05-distributed-git" href="ch05-distributed-git.xhtml" class="xref">Distributed Git</a>.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">oneline</code> and <code class="literal">format</code> options are particularly useful with another <code class="literal">log</code> option called <code class="literal">--graph</code>.
This option adds a nice little ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --pretty=format:<span style="font-style: italic">&quot;%h %s&quot;</span> --graph

<section class="sect2" title="Limiting Log Output">
<h3 id="_limiting_log_output">Limiting Log Output</h3>
<p>In addition to output-formatting options, <code class="literal">git log</code> takes a number of useful limiting options; that is, options that let you show only a subset of commits.
You&#8217;ve seen one such option already&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the <code class="literal">-2</code> option, which displays only the last two commits.
In fact, you can do <code class="literal">-&lt;n&gt;</code>, where <code class="literal">n</code> is any integer to show the last <code class="literal">n</code> commits.
In reality, you&#8217;re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.</p>
<p>However, the time-limiting options such as <code class="literal">--since</code> and <code class="literal">--until</code> are very useful.
For example, this command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --since=2.weeks</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command works with lots of formats&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can specify a specific date like <code class="literal">"2008-01-15"</code>, or a relative date such as <code class="literal">"2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago"</code>.</p>
<p>You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria.
The <code class="literal">--author</code> option allows you to filter on a specific author, and the <code class="literal">--grep</code> option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="Note" epub:type="note">
<div class="content">
<p>You can specify more than one instance of both the <code class="literal">--author</code> and <code class="literal">--grep</code> search criteria, which
will limit the commit output to commits that match <em>any</em> of the <code class="literal">--author</code> patterns and <em>any</em>
of the <code class="literal">--grep</code> patterns; however, adding the <code class="literal">--all-match</code> option further limits the output to
just those commits that match <em>all</em> <code class="literal">--grep</code> patterns.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Another really helpful filter is the <code class="literal">-S</code> option (colloquially referred to as Git&#8217;s “pickaxe” option), which takes a string and shows only those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that string.
For instance, if you wanted to find the last commit that added or removed a reference to a specific function, you could call:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log -S function_name</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The last really useful option to pass to <code class="literal">git log</code> as a filter is a path.
If you specify a directory or file name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files.
This is always the last option and is generally preceded by double dashes (<code class="literal">--</code>) to separate the paths from the options.</p>
<p>In <a id="xref-limit_options" href="#limit_options" class="xref">Options to limit the output of <code class="literal">git log</code></a> we&#8217;ll list these and a few other common options for your reference.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to see which commits modifying test files in the Git source code history were committed by Junio Hamano in the month of October 2008 and are not merge commits, you can run something like this:</p>

<aside class="admonition tip" title="Tip: Preventing the display of merge commits" epub:type="help">
<h2>Preventing the display of merge commits</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>Depending on the workflow used in your repository, it&#8217;s possible that a sizable percentage of the commits in your log history are just merge commits, which typically aren&#8217;t very informative.
To prevent the display of merge commits cluttering up your log history, simply add the log option <code class="literal">--no-merges</code>.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Undoing Things">
<h2 id="_undoing">Undoing Things</h2>
<p>At any stage, you may want to undo something.
Here, we&#8217;ll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you&#8217;ve made.
Be careful, because you can&#8217;t always undo some of these undos.
This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.</p>
<p>One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message.
If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the <code class="literal">--amend</code> option:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit --amend</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit.
If you&#8217;ve made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you&#8217;ll change is your commit message.</p>
<p>The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit.
You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.</p>
<p>As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit -m <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;initial commit&#39;</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add forgotten_file
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git commit --amend</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You end up with a single commit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the second commit replaces the results of the first.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="Note" epub:type="note">
<div class="content">
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that when you&#8217;re amending your last commit, you&#8217;re not so much fixing it as <em>replacing</em> it entirely with a new, improved commit that pushes the old commit out of the way and puts the new commit in its place.
Effectively, it&#8217;s as if the previous commit never happened, and it won&#8217;t show up in your repository history.</p>
<p>The obvious value to amending commits is to make minor improvements to your last commit, without cluttering your repository history with commit messages of the form, “Oops, forgot to add a file” or “Darn, fixing a typo in last commit”.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<section class="sect2" title="Unstaging a Staged File">
<h3 id="_unstaging">Unstaging a Staged File</h3>
<p>The next two sections demonstrate how to work with your staging area and working directory changes.
The nice part is that the command you use to determine the state of those two areas also reminds you how to undo changes to them.
For example, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve changed two files and want to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type <code class="literal">git add *</code> and stage them both.
How can you unstage one of the two?
The <code class="literal">git status</code> command reminds you:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git add *
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Right below the “Changes to be committed” text, it says use <code class="literal">git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...</code> to unstage.
So, let&#8217;s use that advice to unstage the <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	CONTRIBUTING.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The command is a bit strange, but it works.
The <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file is modified but once again unstaged.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="Note" epub:type="note">
<div class="content">
<p>It&#8217;s true that <code class="literal">git reset</code> can be a dangerous command, especially if you provide the <code class="literal">--hard</code> flag.
However, in the scenario described above, the file in your working directory is not touched, so it&#8217;s relatively safe.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>For now this magic invocation is all you need to know about the <code class="literal">git reset</code> command.
We&#8217;ll go into much more detail about what <code class="literal">reset</code> does and how to master it to do really interesting things in <a id="xref--ch07-git-tools--_git_reset" href="ch07-git-tools.xhtml#_git_reset" class="xref">Reset Demystified</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Unmodifying a Modified File">
<h3 id="_unmodifying_a_modified_file">Unmodifying a Modified File</h3>
<p>What if you realize that you don&#8217;t want to keep your changes to the <code class="literal">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file?
How can you easily unmodify it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed (or initially cloned, or however you got it into your working directory)?
Luckily, <code class="literal">git status</code> tells you how to do that, too.
In the last example output, the unstaged area looks like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span>Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>It tells you pretty explicitly how to discard the changes you&#8217;ve made.
Let&#8217;s do what it says:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that the changes have been reverted.</p>
<aside class="admonition important" title="Important" epub:type="warning">
<div class="content">
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that <code class="literal">git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;</code> is a dangerous command.
Any local changes you made to that file are gone&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Git just replaced that file with the most recently-committed version.
Don&#8217;t ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don&#8217;t want those unsaved local changes.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>If you would like to keep the changes you&#8217;ve made to that file but still need to get it out of the way for now, we&#8217;ll go over stashing and branching in <a href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml" class="xref">Git Branching</a>; these are generally better ways to go.</p>
<p>Remember, anything that is <em>committed</em> in Git can almost always be recovered.
Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an <code class="literal">--amend</code> commit can be recovered (see <a id="xref--ch10-git-internals--_data_recovery" href="ch10-git-internals.xhtml#_data_recovery" class="xref">Data Recovery</a> for data recovery).
However, anything you lose that was never committed is likely never to be seen again.</p>

<section class="sect1" title="Working with Remotes">
<h2 id="_remote_repos">Working with Remotes</h2>
<p>To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories.
Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.
Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work.
Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more.
In this section, we&#8217;ll cover some of these remote-management skills.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="Note: Remote repositories can be on your local machine." epub:type="note">
<h2>Remote repositories can be on your local machine.</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>It is entirely possible that you can be working with a “remote” repository that is, in fact, on the same host you are.
The word “remote” does not necessarily imply that the repository is somewhere else on the network or Internet, only that it is elsewhere.
Working with such a remote repository would still involve all the standard pushing, pulling and fetching operations as with any other remote.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<section class="sect2" title="Showing Your Remotes">
<h3 id="_showing_your_remotes">Showing Your Remotes</h3>
<p>To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the <code class="literal">git remote</code> command.
It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you&#8217;ve specified.
If you&#8217;ve cloned your repository, you should at least see <code class="literal">origin</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git clone https://github.com/schacon/ticgit

Checking connectivity... done.
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cd ticgit
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote
origin</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can also specify <code class="literal">-v</code>, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all.
For example, a repository with multiple remotes for working with several collaborators might look something like this.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> cd grit
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote -v
bakkdoor  https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (fetch)
bakkdoor  https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (push)
cho45     https://github.com/cho45/grit (fetch)
cho45     https://github.com/cho45/grit (push)
defunkt   https://github.com/defunkt/grit (fetch)
defunkt   https://github.com/defunkt/grit (push)
koke      git://github.com/koke/grit.git (fetch)
koke      git://github.com/koke/grit.git (push)
origin    git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (push)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily.
We may additionally have permission to push to one or more of these, though we can&#8217;t tell that here.</p>
<p>Notice that these remotes use a variety of protocols; we&#8217;ll cover more about this in <a href="ch04-git-on-the-server.xhtml#_getting_git_on_a_server" class="xref">Getting Git on a Server</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Adding Remote Repositories">
<h3 id="_adding_remote_repositories">Adding Remote Repositories</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the <code class="literal">git clone</code> command implicitly adds the <code class="literal">origin</code> remote for you.
Here&#8217;s how to add a new remote explicitly.
To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run <code class="literal">git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote
origin
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now you can use the string <code class="literal">pb</code> on the command line in lieu of the whole URL.
For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don&#8217;t yet have in your repository, you can run <code class="literal">git fetch pb</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git fetch pb

From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; pb/master
 * [new branch]      ticgit     -&gt; pb/ticgit</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Paul&#8217;s master branch is now accessible locally as <code class="literal">pb/master</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it.
(We&#8217;ll go over what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in <a href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml" class="xref">Git Branching</a>.)</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes">
<h3 id="_fetching_and_pulling">Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</h3>
<p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don&#8217;t have yet.
After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.</p>
<p>If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”.
So, <code class="literal">git fetch origin</code> fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it.
It&#8217;s important to note that the <code class="literal">git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your local repository&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it doesn&#8217;t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you&#8217;re currently working on.
You have to merge it manually into your work when you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section and <a href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml" class="xref">Git Branching</a> for more information), you can use the <code class="literal">git pull</code> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch.
This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <code class="literal">git clone</code> command automatically sets up your local master branch to track the remote master branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from.
Running <code class="literal">git pull</code> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you&#8217;re currently working on.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Pushing to Your Remotes">
<h3 id="_pushing_remotes">Pushing to Your Remotes</h3>
<p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream.
The command for this is simple: <code class="literal">git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code>.
If you want to push your master branch to your <code class="literal">origin</code> server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you&#8217;ve done back up to the server:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git push origin master</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime.
If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected.
You&#8217;ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you&#8217;ll be allowed to push.
See <a href="ch03-git-branching.xhtml" class="xref">Git Branching</a> for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Inspecting a Remote">
<h3 id="_inspecting_remote">Inspecting a Remote</h3>
<p>If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the <code class="literal">git remote show &lt;remote&gt;</code> command.
If you run this command with a particular shortname, such as <code class="literal">origin</code>, you get something like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
  Push  URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    master                               tracked
    dev-branch                           tracked
  Local branch configured for &#39;git pull&#39;:
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for &#39;git push&#39;:
    master pushes to master (up to date)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information.
The command helpfully tells you that if you&#8217;re on the master branch and you run <code class="literal">git pull</code>, it will automatically merge in the master branch on the remote after it fetches all the remote references.
It also lists all the remote references it has pulled down.</p>
<p>That is a simple example you&#8217;re likely to encounter.
When you&#8217;re using Git more heavily, however, you may see much more information from <code class="literal">git remote show</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote show origin

  Push  URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    master                           tracked
    dev-branch                       tracked
    markdown-strip                   tracked
    issue-43                         new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
    issue-45                         new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
    refs/remotes/origin/issue-11     stale (use &#39;git remote prune&#39; to remove)
  Local branches configured for &#39;git pull&#39;:
    dev-branch merges with remote dev-branch
    master     merges with remote master
  Local refs configured for &#39;git push&#39;:
    dev-branch                     pushes to dev-branch                     (up to date)
    markdown-strip                 pushes to markdown-strip                 (up to date)
    master                         pushes to master                         (up to date)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command shows which branch is automatically pushed to when you run <code class="literal">git push</code> while on certain branches.
It also shows you which remote branches on the server you don&#8217;t yet have, which remote branches you have that have been removed from the server, and multiple local branches that are able to merge automatically with their remote-tracking branch when you run <code class="literal">git pull</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Renaming and Removing Remotes">
<h3 id="_renaming_and_removing_remotes">Renaming and Removing Remotes</h3>
<p>You can run <code class="literal">git remote rename</code> to change a remote&#8217;s shortname.
For instance, if you want to rename <code class="literal">pb</code> to <code class="literal">paul</code>, you can do so with <code class="literal">git remote rename</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote rename pb paul
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote

</figure>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that this changes all your remote-tracking branch names, too.
What used to be referenced at <code class="literal">pb/master</code> is now at <code class="literal">paul/master</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to remove a remote for some reason&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you&#8217;ve moved the server or are no longer using a particular mirror, or perhaps a contributor isn&#8217;t contributing anymore&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can either use <code class="literal">git remote remove</code> or <code class="literal">git remote rm</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git remote remove paul

<section class="sect1" title="Tagging">
<h2 id="_git_tagging">Tagging</h2>
<p>
Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository&#8217;s history as being important.
Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (<code class="literal">v1.0</code>, <code class="literal">v2.0</code> and so on).
In this section, you&#8217;ll learn how to list existing tags, how to create and delete tags, and what the different types of tags are.</p>
<section class="sect2" title="Listing Your Tags">
<h3 id="_listing_your_tags">Listing Your Tags</h3>
<p>Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward.
Just type <code class="literal">git tag</code> (with optional <code class="literal">-l</code> or <code class="literal">--list</code>):</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag
v1.0
v2.0</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This command lists the tags in alphabetical order; the order in which they are displayed has no real importance.</p>
<p>You can also search for tags that match a particular pattern.
The Git source repo, for instance, contains more than 500 tags.
If you&#8217;re interested only in looking at the 1.8.5 series, you can run this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag -l <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;v1.8.5*&quot;</span>

v1.8.5-rc0
v1.8.5-rc1
v1.8.5-rc2
v1.8.5-rc3
v1.8.5.1
v1.8.5.2
v1.8.5.3
v1.8.5.4
v1.8.5.5</code></pre>

</aside>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Creating Tags">
<h3 id="_creating_tags">Creating Tags</h3>
<p>Git supports two types of tags: <em>lightweight</em> and <em>annotated</em>.</p>
<p>A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn&#8217;t change&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s just a pointer to a specific commit.</p>
<p>Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database.
They&#8217;re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).
It&#8217;s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don&#8217;t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Annotated Tags">
<h3 id="_annotated_tags">Annotated Tags</h3>
<p>
Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple.
The easiest way is to specify <code class="literal">-a</code> when you run the <code class="literal">tag</code> command:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag -a v1.4 -m <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;my version 1.4&quot;</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="literal">-m</code> specifies a tagging message, which is stored with the tag.
If you don&#8217;t specify a message for an annotated tag, Git launches your editor so you can type it in.</p>
<p>You can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the <code class="literal">git show</code> command:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show v1.4
tag v1.4

<p>That shows the tagger information, the date the commit was tagged, and the annotation message before showing the commit information.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Lightweight Tags">
<h3 id="_lightweight_tags">Lightweight Tags</h3>
<p>
Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag.
This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no other information is kept.
To create a lightweight tag, don&#8217;t supply any of the <code class="literal">-a</code>, <code class="literal">-s</code>, or <code class="literal">-m</code> options, just provide a tag name:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag v1.4-lw
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4
v1.4-lw
v1.5</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This time, if you run <code class="literal">git show</code> on the tag, you don&#8217;t see the extra tag information.
The command just shows the commit:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git show v1.4-lw

</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Tagging Later">
<h3 id="_tagging_later">Tagging Later</h3>
<p>You can also tag commits after you&#8217;ve moved past them.
Suppose your commit history looks like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git log --pretty=oneline

</figure>
<p>Now, suppose you forgot to tag the project at v1.2, which was at the “updated rakefile” commit.
You can add it after the fact.
To tag that commit, you specify the commit checksum (or part of it) at the end of the command:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can see that you&#8217;ve tagged the commit:</p>

<section class="sect2" title="Sharing Tags">
<h3 id="_sharing_tags">Sharing Tags</h3>
<p>By default, the <code class="literal">git push</code> command doesn&#8217;t transfer tags to remote servers.
You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them.
This process is just like sharing remote branches&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can run <code class="literal">git push origin &lt;tagname&gt;</code>.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git push origin v1.5

</figure>
<p>If you have a lot of tags that you want to push up at once, you can also use the <code class="literal">--tags</code> option to the <code class="literal">git push</code> command.
This will transfer all of your tags to the remote server that are not already there.</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git push origin --tags

<p>Now, when someone else clones or pulls from your repository, they will get all your tags as well.</p>
<aside class="admonition note" title="Note: git push pushes both types of tags" epub:type="note">
<h2><code class="literal">git push</code> pushes both types of tags</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>Pushing tags using <code class="literal">git push &lt;remote&gt; --tags</code> does not distinguish between lightweight and annotated tags; there is no simple option that allows you to select just one type for pushing.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Deleting Tags">
<h3 id="_deleting_tags">Deleting Tags</h3>
<p>To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use <code class="literal">git tag -d &lt;tagname&gt;</code>.
For example, we could remove our lightweight tag above as follows:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git tag -d v1.4-lw
Deleted tag &#39;v1.4-lw&#39; (was e7d5add)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Note that this does not remove the tag from any remote servers.
There are two common variations for deleting a tag from a remote server.</p>
<p>The first variation is <code class="literal">git push &lt;remote&gt; :refs/tags/&lt;tagname&gt;</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git push origin :refs/tags/v1.4-lw
To /git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         v1.4-lw</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The way to interpret the above is to read it as the null value before the colon is being pushed to the remote tag name, effectively deleting it.</p>
<p>The second (and more intuitive) way to delete a remote tag is with:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git push origin --delete &lt;tagname&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>
</section>
<section class="sect2" title="Checking out Tags">
<h3 id="_checking_out_tags">Checking out Tags</h3>
<p>If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a <code class="literal">git checkout</code> of that tag, although this puts your repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout 2.0.0
Note: checking out &#39;2.0.0&#39;.

You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch&gt;

HEAD is now at 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final

<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout 2.0-beta-0.1
Previous HEAD position was 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final
HEAD is now at df3f601... add atlas.json and cover image</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>In “detached HEAD” state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag will stay the same, but your new commit won&#8217;t belong to any branch and will be unreachable, except by the exact commit hash.
Thus, if you need to make changes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;say you&#8217;re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you will generally want to create a branch:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
Switched to a new branch &#39;version2&#39;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>If you do this and make a commit, your <code class="literal">version2</code> branch will be slightly different than your <code class="literal">v2.0.0</code> tag since it will move forward with your new changes, so do be careful.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="sect1" title="Git Aliases">
<h2 id="_git_aliases">Git Aliases</h2>
<p>
Before we finish this chapter on basic Git, there&#8217;s just one little tip that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.
We won&#8217;t refer to them or assume you&#8217;ve used them later in the book, but you should probably know how to use them.</p>
<p>Git doesn&#8217;t automatically infer your command if you type it in partially.
If you don&#8217;t want to type the entire text of each of the Git commands, you can easily set up an alias for each command using <code class="literal">git config</code>.
Here are a couple of examples you may want to set up:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global alias.co checkout
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global alias.br branch
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global alias.ci commit
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global alias.st status</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This means that, for example, instead of typing <code class="literal">git commit</code>, you just need to type <code class="literal">git ci</code>.
As you go on using Git, you&#8217;ll probably use other commands frequently as well; don&#8217;t hesitate to create new aliases.</p>
<p>This technique can also be very useful in creating commands that you think should exist.
For example, to correct the usability problem you encountered with unstaging a file, you can add your own unstage alias to Git:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global alias.unstage <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;reset HEAD --&#39;</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This makes the following two commands equivalent:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git unstage fileA
<span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git reset HEAD -- fileA</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This seems a bit clearer.
It&#8217;s also common to add a <code class="literal">last</code> command, like this:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git config --global alias.last <span style="font-style: italic">&#39;log -1 HEAD&#39;</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This way, you can see the last commit easily:</p>
<figure class="listing">
<pre class="source language-console"><code><span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">$</span> git last
commit 66938dae3329c7aebe598c2246a8e6af90d04646

    test for current head

    Signed-off-by: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@example.com&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>As you can tell, Git simply replaces the new command with whatever you alias it for.
However, maybe you want to run an external command, rather than a Git subcommand.
In that case, you start the command with a <code class="literal">!</code> character.
This is useful if you write your own tools that work with a Git repository.
We can demonstrate by aliasing <code class="literal">git visual</code> to run <code class="literal">gitk</code>:</p>
<figure class="listing">
