            Welcome to the Spring Data Graph Guide Book. Thank you for taking the time to get an in depth look
            into <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-graph" target="_top">Spring Data Graph</a>.
            This project is part of the <a class="ulink" href="http://springsource.org/spring-data" target="_top">Spring Data project</a>,
            which brings the convenient programming model of the Spring Framework to modern NOSQL databases.
     		Spring Data Graph, as the name alludes to, aims to provide support for graph databases. It currently
            supports <a class="ulink" href="http://neo4j.org" target="_top">Neo4j</a>.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e77"></a>2.&nbsp;Feedback</h2></div></div></div><p>
            It was written by developers for developers. Hopefully we've created a guide that is well received
            by our peers.
        </p><p>
            If you have any feedback on Spring Data Graph or this book, please provide it via the
            <a class="ulink" href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAGRAPH" target="_top">SpringSource JIRA</a>, the

        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e96"></a>3.&nbsp;Format of the Book</h2></div></div></div><p>
            This book is presented as a <a class="ulink" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuplexBook.html" target="_top">duplex book</a>,
            a term coined by Martin Fowler. A duplex book consists of at least two parts. The first part is an easily
            accessible tutorial that gives the reader an overview of the topics contained in the book. It contains lots
            of examples and discussion topics. This part of the book is highly suited for cover-to-cover reading.
        </p><p>
            We chose a tutorial describing the creation of a web application that allows movie enthusiasts to
            find their favorite movies, rate them, connect with fellow movie geeks, and enjoy social features such as
            recommendations. The application is running on Neo4j using Spring Data Graph and the well-known Spring
            Web Stack.
        </p><p>
            The second part of the book is the classic reference documentation, containing detailed information about
            the library. It discusses the programming model, the underlying assumptions, and internals, as well as the
            APIs for the object-graph mapping. The reference documentation is typically used to look up concrete bits of
            information, or to drill down into certain topics. For hackers wanting to really delve into Spring Data
            Graph, it can of course also be read cover-to-cover.

            We would like to thank everyone who contributed to this book, especially Mark Pollack and Thomas Risberg,
            the leads of the Spring Data Project, who helped a lot during the development of the library as well as sharing
            great feedback about the book. Also Oliver Gierke, our local German VMWare/SpringSource engineer, who invested a
            lot of time discussing various aspects of the library as well as providing the superb foundations for the Spring
            Data Repositories. We tortured Andy Clement, the AspectJ project lead, with many questions and issues around our
            advanced AspectJ usage which caused some headaches. He always quickly solved our issues and gave us excellent
            answers.
        </p><p>
            We also appreciate very much the foresight of Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem to initiate the project, and now
            also providing great forewords. Their leadership inspired collaboration between the engineering teams at
            SpringSource and Neo Technology, a tremendous help during the making of Spring Data Graph.
            &nbsp;

        <p>
            Last but not least we thank our vibrant community, both in the Spring Forums as well as on the Neo4j
            Mailing list and on many other places on the internet for giving us feedback, reporting issues and suggesting
            improvements. Without that important feedback we wouldn't be where we are today.
