        This chapter covers two distinct topics that happen share a common solution in Seam, (web) clustering and EJB
        passivation. Therefore, they are addressed together in this reference manual. Although performance tends to be
        grouped in this category as well, it's kept separate because the focus of this chapter is on the programming
        model and how it's affected by the use of the aforementioned features.
    </p><p>
        In this chapter you will learn how Seam manages the passivation of Seam components and entity instances, how to
        activate this feature, and how this feature is related to clustering. You will also learn how to deploy a Seam
        application into a cluster and verify that HTTP session replication is working properly. Let's start with a
        little background on clustering and see an example of how you deploy a Seam application to a JBoss AS cluster.
    </p><div class="sect1" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d0e30022"/>36.1. Clustering</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Clustering (more formally web clustering) allows an application to run on two or more parallel servers
            (i.e., nodes) while providing a uniform view of the application to clients. Load is distributed across the
            servers in such a way that if one or more of the servers fails, the application is still accessible via any
            of the surviving nodes. This topology is crucial for building scalable enterprise applications as
            performance and availability can be improved simply by adding nodes. But it brings up an important question.
            <span class="emphasis"><em>What happens to the state that was on the server that failed?</em></span>
        </p><p>
           Since day one, Seam has always provided support for stateful applications running in a cluster. Up to this
           point, you have learned that Seam provides state management in the form of additional scopes and by governing
           the life cycle of stateful (scoped) components. But state management in Seam goes beyond creating, storing
           and destroying instances. Seam tracks changes to JavaBean components and stores the changes at strategic
           points during the request so that the changes can be restored when the request shifts to a secondary node in
           the cluster. Fortunately, monitoring and replication of stateful EJB components is already handled by the EJB
           server, so this feature of Seam is intended to put stateful JavaBeans on par with their EJB cohorts.
        </p><p>
            But wait, there's more! Seam also offers an incredibly unique feature for clustered applications. In
            addition to monitoring JavaBean components, Seam ensures that managed entity instances (i.e. JPA and
            Hibernate entities) don't become detached during replication. Seam keeps a record of the entities that are
            loaded and automatically loads them on the secondary node. You must, however, be using a Seam-managed
            persistence context to get this feature. More in depth information about this feature is provided in the
            second half of this chapter.
        </p><p>
            Now that you understand what features Seam offers to support a clustered environment, let's look at how you
            program for clustering.
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e30036"/>36.1.1. Programming for clustering</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Any session- or conversation-scoped mutable JavaBean component that will be used in a clustered
                environment must implement the <code class="literal">org.jboss.seam.core.Mutable</code> interface from the Seam API. As part of the
                contract, the component must maintain a dirty flag that is reported and reset by the
                <code class="literal">clearDirty()</code> method. Seam calls this method to determine if it is necessary to
                replicate the component. This avoids having to use the more cumbersome Servlet API to add and remove the
                session attribute on every change of the object.
            </p><p>
               You also must ensure that all session- and conversation-scoped JavaBean components are Serializable.
               Additional, all fields of a stateful component (EJB or JavaBean) must Serializable unless the field is
               marked transient or set to null in a <code class="literal">@PrePassivate</code> method. You can restore the value
               of a transient or nullified field in a <code class="literal">@PostActivate</code> method.
            </p><p>
               One area where people often get bitten is by using <code class="literal">List.subList</code> to create a list. The
               resulting list is not Serializable. So watch out for situations like that. If hit a
               <code class="literal">java.io.NotSerializableException</code> and cannot locate the culprit at first glance, you
               can put a breakpoint on this exception, run the application server in debug mode and attach a debugger
               (such as Eclipse) to see what deserialization is choking on.
            </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>
                    Please note that clustering does not work with hot deployable components. But then again, you shouldn't
                    be using hot deployable components in a non-development environment anyway.

                The procedure outlined in this tutorial has been validated with an seam-gen application and the Seam

                In the tutorial, I assume that the IP addresses of the master and slave servers are 192.168.1.2 and
                192.168.1.3, respectively. I am intentionally not using the mod_jk load balancer so that it's easier to

                    JBoss AS clustering relies on UDP multicasting provided by jGroups. The SELinux configuration that
                    ships with RHEL/Fedora blocks these packets by default. You can allow them to pass by modifying the
                    iptables rules (as root). The following commands apply to an IP address that matches 192.168.1.x.

            The ManagedEntityInterceptor (MEI) is an optional interceptor in Seam that gets applied to
            conversation-scoped components when enabled. Enabling it is simple. You just set the distributable property

            Note that this doesn't enable replication of HTTP sessions, but it does prepare Seam to be able to deal with
            passivation of either EJB components or components in the HTTP session.
        </p><p>
            The MEI serves two distinct scenarios (EJB passivation and HTTP session passivation), although to accomplish
            the same overall goal. It ensures that throughout the life of a conversation using at least one extended
            persistence context, the entity instances loaded by the persistence context(s) remain managed (they do not
            become detached prematurely by a passivation event). In short, it ensures the integrity of the extended
            persistence context (and therefore its guarantees).
        </p><p>
            The previous statement implies that there is a challenge that threatens this contract. In fact, there are
            two. One case is when a stateful session bean (SFSB) that hosts an extended persistence context is
            passivated (to save memory or to migrate it to another node in the cluster) and the second is when the HTTP
            session is passivated (to prepare it to be migrated to another node in the cluster).
        </p><p>
            I first want to discuss the general problem of passivation and then look at the two challenges cited
            individually.
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e30225"/>36.2.1. The friction between passivation and persistence</h3></div></div></div><p>
                The persistence context is where the persistence manager (i.e., JPA EntityManager or Hibernate Session)
                stores entity instances (i.e., objects) it has loaded from the database (via the object-relational
                mappings). Within a persistence context, there is no more than one object per unique database record.
                The persistence context is often referred to as the first-level cache because if the application asks
                for a record by its unique identifier that has already been loaded into the persistence context, a call
                to the database is avoided. But it's about more than just caching.
            </p><p>
                Objects held in the persistence context can be modified, which the persistence manager tracks. When an
                object is modified, it's considered "dirty". The persistence manager will migrate these changes to the
                database using a technique known as write-behind (which basically means only when necessary). Thus, the
                persistence context maintains a set of pending changes to the database.
            </p><p>
                Database-oriented applications do much more than just read from and write to the database. They capture
                transactional bits of information that need to be transferred into the database atomically (at once). It's
                not always possible to capture this information all on one screen. Additionally, the user might need to
                make a judgement call about whether to approve or reject the pending changes.
            </p><p>
                What we are getting at here is that the idea of a transaction from the user's perspective needs to be
                extended. And that is why the extended persistence context fits so perfectly with this requirement. It
                can hold such changes for as long as the application can keep it open and then use the built-in
                capabilities of the persistence manager to push these pending changes to the database without requiring
                the application developer to worry about the low-level details (a simple call to
                <code class="literal">EntityManager#flush()</code> does the trick).
            </p><p>
                The link between the persistence manager and the entity instances is maintained using object references.
                The entity instances are serializable, but the persistence manager (and in turn its persistence context)
                is not. Therefore, the process of serialization works against this design. Serialization can occur
                either when a SFSB or the HTTP session is passivated. In order to sustain the activity in the
                application, the persistence manager and the entity instances it manages must weather serialization
                without losing their relationship. That's the aid that the MEI provides.

                Conversations were initially designed with stateful session beans (SFSBs) in mind, primarily because the
                EJB 3 specification designates SFSBs as hosts of the extended persistence context. Seam introduces a
                complement to the extended persistence context, known as a Seam-managed persistence context, which works
                around a number of limitations in the specification (complex propagation rules and lack of manual
                flushing). Both can be used with a SFSB.
            </p><p>
                A SFSB relies on a client to hold a reference to it in order to keep it active. Seam has provided an
                ideal place for this reference in the conversation context. Thus, for as long as the conversation
                context is active, the SFSB is active. If an EntityManager is injected into that SFSB using the
                annotation @PersistenceContext(EXTENDED), then that EntityManager will be bound to the SFSB and remain
                open throughout its lifetime, the lifetime of the conversation. If an EntityManager is injected using
                @In, then that EntityManager is maintained by Seam and stored directly in the conversation context, thus
                living for the lifetime of the conversation independent of the lifetime of the SFSB.
            </p><p>
                With all of that said, the Java EE container can passivate a SFSB, which means it will serialize the
                object to an area of storage external to the JVM. When this happens depends on the settings of the
                individual SFSB. This process can even be disabled. However, the persistence context is not serialized
                (is this only true of SMPC?). In fact, what happens depends highly on the Java EE container. The spec is
                not very clear about this situation. Many vendors just tell you not to let it happen if you need the
                guarantees of the extended persistence context. Seam's approach is more conservative. Seam basically
                doesn't trust the SFSB with the persistence context or the entity instances. After each invocation of
                the SFSB, Seam moves the reference to entity instance held by the SFSB into the current conversation
                (and therefore into the HTTP session), nullifying those fields on the SFSB. It then restores this
                references at the beginning of the next invocation. Of course, Seam is already storing the persistence
                manager in the conversation. Thus, when the SFSB passivates and later activates, it has absolutely no
                averse affect on the application.
            </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>
                    If you are using SFSBs in your application that hold references to extended persistence contexts,
                    and those SFSBs can passivate, then you must use the MEI. This requirement holds even if you are
                    using a single instance (not a cluster). However, if you are using clustered SFSB, then this
                    requirement also applies.
                </p></div><p>
                It is possible to disable passivation on a SFSB. See the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-9656">Ejb3DisableSfsbPassivation</a> page on the JBoss
                Wiki for details.

                Dealing with passivation of a SFSB works by leveraging the HTTP session. But what happens when the HTTP
                session passivates? This happens in a clustered environment with session replication enabled. This case
                is much tricker to deal with and is where a bulk of the MEI infrastructure comes into play. In this
                case, the persistence manager is going to be destroyed because it cannot be serialized. Seam handles
                this deconstruction (hence ensuring that the HTTP session serializes properly). But what happens on the
                other end. Well, when the MEI sticks an entity instance into the conversation, it embeds the instance in
                a wrapper that provides information on how to re-associate the instance with a persistence manager
                post-serialization. So when the application jumps to another node in the cluster (presumably because the
                target node went down) the MEI infrastructure essentially reconstructs the persistence context. The huge
                drawback here is that since the persistence context is being reconstructed (from the database), pending
                changes are dropped. However, what Seam does do is ensure that if the entity instance is versioned, that
                the guarantees of optimistic locking are upheld. (why isn't the dirty state transferred?)
            </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>
                    If you are deploying your application in a cluster and using HTTP session replication, you must use the MEI.

                The important point of this section is that the MEI is there for a reason. It's there to ensure that the
                extended persistence context can retain intact in the face of passivation (of either a SFSB or the HTTP
                session). This matters because the natural design of Seam applications (and conversational state in
                general) revolve around the state of this resource.
