		JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 is an open-source JEE-based middleware solution. It is built on top of the consolidated JBoss Application Server 5 called JBoss Enterprise Application Server, which introduces the JBoss Microcontainer.
	</div><div class="para">
		The JBoss architecture essentially consists of the microcontainer, bootstrap beans loaded into the microcontainer, a collection of deployers for loading various deployment types, and various MBean (<code class="filename">*-jboss-beans.xml</code>) and legacy MBean (<code class="filename">*.jboss-service.xml</code>) deployments. For more information refer to the <em class="citetitle">Administration and Configuration Guide</em>.

      ⁠</a>2.1. Server Profiles</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
		JBoss Enterprise Application Server, the core of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, can be run with different basic configurations. The configuration are based on server profiles. A profile defines which services and components are available for the server instance of that profile. JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is shipped with predefined profiles; however, you can customize these profiles, remove and add individual services and components to them, as well as to create your own profiles (refer to the <em class="citetitle">Administration and Configuration Guide</em>).
	</div><div class="para">
		The following JBoss Enterprise Application Server profiles are delivered with the product and located in the <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable">&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;</em>jboss-as/server/</code> directory:

					The <code class="literal">all</code> profile covers all available services and components, including the RMI/IIOP and clustering services, which are not loaded in the default configuration.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">default</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					The <code class="literal">default</code> profile is a base Java EE 5 server profile containing a default set of services. It covers the most frequently used services required to deploy a Java EE application. The JAXR service, the IIOP service and the clustering services are not included. This profile is applied if a server is started without specifying a configuration.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">production</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					The <code class="literal">production</code> profile is based on the <code class="literal">all</code> profile and is intended for production. It has a reduced log verbosity, deployment scanning takes place every 60 seconds, and memory usage is tuned to accommodate production deployment requirements.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">minimal</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					The <code class="literal">minimal</code> profile uses the minimum services required to start JBoss. It starts the logging service, a JNDI server and a URL deployment scanner to find new deployments. You can use it when using JMX/JBoss to start your own services without any other Java EE 5 technologies. It starts only the server: no web container, EJB, or JMS support is available.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">standard</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					The <code class="literal">standard</code> profile is the JavaEE 5 certified configuration of services.

					The <code class="literal">web</code> profile is a lightweight web-container oriented profile that previews the JavaEE 6 web profile.
				</div></dd></dl></div><div class="para">
		The <code class="literal">default</code> profile is used if you do not specify a configuration when running a server.
