      ⁠</a>Chapter 8. Production Configuration</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
		In several chapters of this book it's been mentioned that the suggested optimizations are already present in the production configuration. Understanding just what this configuration is and how it was created can be useful in optimizing the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. The production configuration was created with the aim of making the platform production-ready quickly and easily. By default, clustering and caching is enabled so that customers immediately have the benefit of these high-availability features. Although it's a good starting point for a real-life configuration, it should be tuned to best meet the application's requirements.

		The main differences between the production and other configurations are:
	</div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Console logging is disabled.
			</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Asynchronous appender for logging is enabled.
			</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Logging verbosity is turned down in many cases.
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Additional categories are defined to limit logging.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Default logging level is debug, but is overridden by the limit categories that were added.
					</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
								This enables support to make things easier for customers to turn on debug level logging for various components, since the customer can just comment out the limiting category, and they will have debug logging for it.
							</div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				The cached connection manager is set to not be in debug mode.
			</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Clustering is properly configured to work with supported databases.
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						In the “all” configuration, the configuration is created to support the HSQL database, which is bundled for convenience with the server, but does not support clustering properly.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						This is specifically the UUID generator.
					</div></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				The heap size is set higher than in the community edition.
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Typically the heap size for the JVM is set to 512 megabytes in the community edition. For the platform it's set to the largest value possible for a 32-bit JVM across all platforms.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						The largest 32-bit setting that works across all supported JVM and operating systems is 1.3 gigabytes (Windows sets the limit).
					</div></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				All administration is secured by default.
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						This was recently done in the community releases as well, so its now the same as the rest.
					</div></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Hot deployment is still turned on by default, but the scan rate is changed from every 5 seconds to once per minute.
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						It could be disabled altogether but many customers do use it in production and if there a large number of deployments, scanning every 5 seconds can affect performance badly.
