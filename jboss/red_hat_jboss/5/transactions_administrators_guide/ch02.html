		Within the Transaction Service installation, the Object Store is updated regularly, whenever transactions are created, or when Transactional Objects for Java is used. In a failure-free environment, the only object states within the object store are those representing objects created with the Transactional Objects for Java API.

		However, if failures occur, transaction logs may remain in the object store until crash recovery facilities have resolved the transactions they represent. Therefore, it is very important that the contents of the object store are not deleted inadvertently, as this will make it impossible to resolve in-doubt transactions. In addition, if multiple users share the same object store, they must understand that it is not an exclusive resource, and not delete transaction logs without careful consideration.
