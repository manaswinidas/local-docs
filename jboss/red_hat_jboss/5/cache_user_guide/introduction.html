      ⁠</a>1.1. What is JBoss Cache?</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
			JBoss Cache is a tree-structured, clustered, transactional cache. It can be used in a standalone, non-clustered environment, to cache frequently accessed data in memory thereby removing data retrieval or calculation bottlenecks while providing "enterprise" features such as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jta">JTA</a> compatibility, eviction and persistence.
		</div><div class="para">
			JBoss Cache is also a clustered cache, and can be used in a cluster to replicate state providing a high degree of failover. A variety of replication modes are supported, including invalidation and buddy replication, and network communications can either be synchronous or asynchronous.
		</div><div class="para">
			When used in a clustered mode, the cache is an effective mechanism of building high availability, fault tolerance and even load balancing into custom applications and frameworks. For example, the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/projects/jbossas/">JBoss Application Server</a> and Red Hat's <a href="http://www.jboss.com">Enterprise Application Platform</a> make extensive use of JBoss Cache to cluster services such as HTTP and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/">EJB</a> sessions, as well as providing a distributed entity cache for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API">JPA</a>.

      ⁠</a>1.1.1. And what is POJO Cache?</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
				POJO Cache is an extension of the core JBoss Cache API. POJO Cache offers additional functionality such as: 
				<div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							maintaining object references even after replication or persistence
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							fine grained replication, where only modified object fields are replicated
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							"API-less" clustering model where POJOs are simply annotated as being clustered
						</div></li></ul></div>

			</div><div class="para">
				POJO Cache has a complete and separate set of documentation, including a Users' Guide, FAQ and tutorial all available on the JBoss Cache <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache">documentation website</a>. As such, POJO Cache will not be discussed further in this book.

      ⁠</a>1.2.1. Caching objects</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
				JBoss Cache offers a simple and straightforward API, where data - simple Java objects - can be placed in the cache. Based on configuration options selected, this data may be one or all of: 
				<div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							cached in-memory for efficient, thread-safe retrieval
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							replicated to some or all cache instances in a cluster
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							persisted to disk and/or a remote, in-memory cache cluster ("far-cache")
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							garbage collected from memory when memory runs low, and passivated to disk so state is not lost
						</div></li></ul></div>
				 In addition, JBoss Cache offers a rich set of enterprise-class features: 
				<div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							being able to participate in JTA transactions (works with most Java EE compliant transaction managers);
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							attach to JMX consoles and provide runtime statistics on the state of the cache;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							allow client code to attach listeners and receive notifications on cache events;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
							allow grouping of cache operations into batches, for efficient replication.
						</div></li></ul></div>

      ⁠</a>1.2.2. Local and clustered modes</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
				The cache is organized as a tree, with a single root. Each node in the tree essentially contains a map, which acts as a store for key/value pairs. The only requirement placed on objects that are cached is that they implement <code class="literal">java.io.Serializable</code>.
			</div><div class="para">
				JBoss Cache can be either local or replicated. Local caches exist only within the scope of the JVM in which they are created, whereas replicated caches propagate any changes to some or all other caches in the same cluster. A cluster may span different hosts on a network or just different JVMs on a single host.
			</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idm140486342172160">
      ⁠</a>1.2.3. Clustered caches and transactions</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
				When a change is made to an object in the cache and that change is done in the context of a transaction, the replication of changes is deferred until the transaction completes successfully. All modifications are kept in a list associated with the transaction of the caller. When the transaction commits, changes are replicated. Otherwise, on a rollback, we simply undo the changes locally and discard the modification list, resulting in zero network traffic and overhead. For example, if a caller makes 100 modifications and then rolls back the transaction, nothing is replicated, resulting in no network traffic.
			</div><div class="para">
				If a caller has no transaction or batch associated with it, modifications are replicated immediately. E.g. in the example used earlier, 100 messages would be broadcast for each modification. In this sense, running without a batch or transaction can be thought of as analogous as running with auto-commit switched on in JDBC terminology, where each operation is committed automatically and immediately.
			</div><div class="para">
				JBoss Cache works out of the box with most popular transaction managers, and even provides an API where custom transaction manager lookups can be written.
			</div><div class="para">
				All of the above holds true for batches as well, which has similar behavior.
			</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idm140486343740736">
      ⁠</a>1.2.4. Thread safety</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
				The cache is completely thread-safe. It employs multi-versioned concurrency control (MVCC) to ensure thread safety between readers and writers, while maintaining a high degree of concurrency. The specific MVCC implementation used in JBoss Cache allows for reader threads to be completely free of locks and synchronized blocks, ensuring a very high degree of performance for read-heavy applications. It also uses custom, highly performant lock implementations that employ modern compare-and-swap techniques for writer threads, which are tuned to multi-core CPU architectures.
			</div><div class="para">
				Multi-versioned concurrency control (MVCC) is the default locking scheme since JBoss Cache 3.x. Optimistic and pessimistic locking schemes from older versions of JBoss Cache are still available but are deprecated in favor of MVCC, and will be removed in future releases. Use of these deprecated locking schemes are strongly discouraged.
			</div><div class="para">
				The JBoss Cache MVCC implementation only supports READ_COMMITTED and REPEATABLE_READ isolation levels, corresponding to their database equivalents. See the section on <a class="xref" href="transactions.html">Chapter 11, <em>Transactions and Concurrency</em></a> for details on MVCC.

      ⁠</a>1.3.  Requirements </h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
			JBoss Cache requires a Java 5.0 (or newer) compatible virtual machine and set of libraries, and is developed and tested on Sun's JDK 5.0 and JDK 6.
		</div><div class="para">
			In addition to Java 5.0, at a minimum, JBoss Cache has dependencies on <a href="http://www.jgroups.org">JGroups</a>, and Apache's <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">commons-logging</a>. JBoss Cache ships with all dependent libraries necessary to run out of the box, as well as several optional jars for optional features.
