      ⁠</a>1.1. About JBoss Enterprise Application Platform</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
			JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the next evolutionary step in open source enterprise software. It is a powerful tool for developing rich, high performance Web 2.0 applications on a pure Java Platform.
		</div><div class="para">
			By integrating best-of-breed open source frameworks such as JBoss Seam, Hibernate, CXF Web Services, JBoss Cache, and JBoss Messaging, the Platform takes advantage of innovations in the open source community. As well, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is fully tested and supported by Red Hat, and is certified to work on many leading enterprise hardware and software products.

      ⁠</a>1.2. About this release</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
			JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 is a minor release. Minor releases aggregate the contents of prior patches and Cumulative Patches (CPs), and may add functionality. Subsequent patches and Cumulative Patches assume the installation of the minor update that preceded them.
		</div><div class="para">
			During the life cycle of a product's major version, Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain API-level compatibility across all minor releases and asynchronous patches, ensuring that, for example, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 maintains API-level compatibility with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.0.0, the initial release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5. Possible exceptions to this rule include fixes addressing critical security issues.

			PicketLink (offered to customers at v1.0.3 in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1) is graduating from Technology Preview to v2.0.1 GA.

			With the release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 customers should update to this release.

			HornetQ is an optional JMS provider for the JBoss Application Platform which can be used in place of the default JBoss Messaging on a <span class="emphasis"><em>fresh</em></span> installation (not upgrades). It will be made available through Red Hat Network (RHN) and Customer Portal asynchronously after the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform release, with its announcement via the same channels. With this release, HornetQ is graduating from Technology Preview to General Availability (GA) v2.2.10-Build2.

				Do not install HornetQ packages (RPMs) if you have already set up JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 with JBoss Messaging or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 with HornetQ TP. Attempts to install HornetQ on such an environment can cause package conflicts. Installation of HornetQ is available for a fresh installation only.

			JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 is a minor release. Compatibility is maintained throughout all minor releases with a major release. This means that all 5.x releases maintain binary compatibility with the initial release, 5.0.0.

				Since the release of Enterprise Application Platform version 5.1.1 it's not possible to perform an upgrade from version 4.3. Specifically, updating to 5.1.1 from 4.3 using RPMs is not supported, and will result in platform failure.

      ⁠</a>1.4.2. Removed</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
				The Java EE 5 Platform Specification required that Stax APIs be included with an implementation of the specification. The Stax APIs have since become part of Java Standard Edition 6. JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 is now built and distributed with Java SE 6 as a minimum SE requirement. To maintain compatibility with the Stax APIs, the Stax API jars are no longer packaged in the distribution.
