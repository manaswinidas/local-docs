      ⁠</a>Chapter 24. Best Practices</h1></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist compact"><dt><span class="term">Write fine-grained classes and map them using <code class="literal">&lt;component&gt;</code>:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Use an <code class="literal">Address</code> class to encapsulate <code class="literal">street</code>, <code class="literal">suburb</code>, <code class="literal">state</code>, <code class="literal">postcode</code>. This encourages code reuse and simplifies refactoring.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Declare identifier properties on persistent classes:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Hibernate makes identifier properties optional. There are a range of reasons why you should use them. We recommend that identifiers be 'synthetic', that is, generated with no business meaning.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Identify natural keys:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Identify natural keys for all entities, and map them using <code class="literal">&lt;natural-id&gt;</code>. Implement <code class="literal">equals()</code> and <code class="literal">hashCode()</code> to compare the properties that make up the natural key.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Place each class mapping in its own file:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Do not use a single monolithic mapping document. Map <code class="literal">com.eg.Foo</code> in the file <code class="literal">com/eg/Foo.hbm.xml</code>. This makes sense, particularly in a team environment.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Load mappings as resources:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Deploy the mappings along with the classes they map.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Consider externalizing query strings:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					This is recommended if your queries call non-ANSI-standard SQL functions. Externalizing the query strings to mapping files will make the application more portable.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Use bind variables.</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					As in JDBC, always replace non-constant values by "?". Do not use string manipulation to bind a non-constant value in a query. You should also consider using named parameters in queries.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Do not manage your own JDBC connections:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Hibernate allows the application to manage JDBC connections, but his approach should be considered a last-resort. If you cannot use the built-in connection providers, consider providing your own implementation of <code class="literal">org.hibernate.connection.ConnectionProvider</code>.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Consider using a custom type:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Suppose you have a Java type from a library that needs to be persisted but does not provide the accessors needed to map it as a component. You should consider implementing <code class="literal">org.hibernate.UserType</code>. This approach frees the application code from implementing transformations to/from a Hibernate type.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Use hand-coded JDBC in bottlenecks:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					In performance-critical areas of the system, some kinds of operations might benefit from direct JDBC. Do not assume, however, that JDBC is necessarily faster. Please wait until you <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> something is a bottleneck. If you need to use direct JDBC, you can open a Hibernate Session and wrap your JDBC operation as a Work object with <code class="methodname">session.doWork(Work)</code>. This way you can still use the same transaction strategy and underlying connection provider.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Understand <code class="literal">Session</code> flushing:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Sometimes the Session synchronizes its persistent state with the database. Performance will be affected if this process occurs too often. You can sometimes minimize unnecessary flushing by disabling automatic flushing, or even by changing the order of queries and other operations within a particular transaction.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">In a three tiered architecture, consider using detached objects:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					When using a servlet/session bean architecture, you can pass persistent objects loaded in the session bean to and from the servlet/JSP layer. Use a new session to service each request. Use <code class="literal">Session.merge()</code> or <code class="literal">Session.saveOrUpdate()</code> to synchronize objects with the database.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">In a two tiered architecture, consider using long persistence contexts:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Database Transactions have to be as short as possible for best scalability. However, it is often necessary to implement long running <span class="emphasis"><em>application transactions</em></span>, a single unit-of-work from the point of view of a user. An application transaction might span several client request/response cycles. It is common to use detached objects to implement application transactions. An appropriate alternative in a two tiered architecture, is to maintain a single open persistence contact session for the whole life cycle of the application transaction. Then simply disconnect from the JDBC connection at the end of each request and reconnect at the beginning of the subsequent request. Never share a single session across more than one application transaction or you will be working with stale data.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Do not treat exceptions as recoverable:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					This is more of a necessary practice than a "best" practice. When an exception occurs, roll back the <code class="literal">Transaction</code> and close the <code class="literal">Session</code>. If you do not do this, Hibernate cannot guarantee that in-memory state accurately represents the persistent state. For example, do not use <code class="literal">Session.load()</code> to determine if an instance with the given identifier exists on the database; use <code class="literal">Session.get()</code> or a query instead.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Prefer lazy fetching for associations:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Use eager fetching sparingly. Use proxies and lazy collections for most associations to classes that are not likely to be completely held in the second-level cache. For associations to cached classes, where there is an extremely high probability of a cache hit, explicitly disable eager fetching using <code class="literal">lazy="false"</code>. When join fetching is appropriate to a particular use case, use a query with a <code class="literal">left join fetch</code>.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term"> Use the <span class="emphasis"><em>open session in view</em></span> pattern, or a disciplined <span class="emphasis"><em>assembly phase</em></span> to avoid problems with unfetched data: </span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Hibernate frees the developer from writing tedious <span class="emphasis"><em>Data Transfer Objects</em></span> (DTO). In a traditional EJB architecture, DTOs serve dual purposes: first, they work around the problem that entity beans are not serializable; second, they implicitly define an assembly phase where all data to be used by the view is fetched and marshaled into the DTOs before returning control to the presentation tier. Hibernate eliminates the first purpose. Unless you are prepared to hold the persistence context (the session) open across the view rendering process, you will still need an assembly phase. Think of your business methods as having a strict contract with the presentation tier about what data is available in the detached objects. This is not a limitation of Hibernate. It is a fundamental requirement of safe transactional data access.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Consider abstracting your business logic from Hibernate:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Hide Hibernate data-access code behind an interface. Combine the <span class="emphasis"><em>DAO</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Thread Local Session</em></span> patterns. You can even have some classes persisted by hand coded JDBC associated to Hibernate via a <code class="literal">UserType</code>. This advice is, however, intended for "sufficiently large" applications. It is not appropriate for an application with five tables.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Do not use exotic association mappings:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Practical test cases for real many-to-many associations are rare. Most of the time you need additional information stored in the "link table". In this case, it is much better to use two one-to-many associations to an intermediate link class. In fact, most associations are one-to-many and many-to-one. For this reason, you should proceed cautiously when using any other association style.
				</div></dd><dt><span class="term">Prefer bidirectional associations:</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
					Unidirectional associations are more difficult to query. In a large application, almost all associations must be navigable in both directions in queries.
