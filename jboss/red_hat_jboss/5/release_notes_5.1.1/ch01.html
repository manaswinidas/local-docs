      ⁠</a>1.1. About JBoss Enterprise Application Platform</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
			JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the next evolutionary step in open source enterprise software. It is a powerful tool for developing rich, high performance Web 2.0 applications on a pure Java Platform.
		</div><div class="para">
			By integrating best-of-breed open source frameworks such as JBoss Seam, Hibernate, CXF Web Services, JBoss Cache, and JBoss Messaging, the Platform takes advantage of innovations in the open source community. As well, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is fully tested and supported by Red Hat, and is certified to work on many leading enterprise hardware and software products.

      ⁠</a>1.2. About this release</h1></div></div></div><div class="para">
			JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 is a minor release. Minor releases aggregate the contents of prior patches and Cumulative Patches (CPs), and may add additional new functionality. Subsequent patches and Cumulative Patches assume the installation of the minor update that preceded them.
		</div><div class="para">
			During the life cycle of a product's major version, Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain API-level compatibility across all minor releases and asynchronous patches, ensuring that, for example, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 maintains API-level compatibility with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.0.0, the initial release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5. Possible exceptions to this rule include fixes addressing critical security issues.
		</div><div class="para">
			With the release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 customers should update to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1.

			JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a minor release. Compatibility is maintained throughout all minor releases with a major release. This means that all 5.x releases maintain binary compatibility with the initial release, 5.0.0. For this reason, no items are excluded, removed, or deprecated from this release.
