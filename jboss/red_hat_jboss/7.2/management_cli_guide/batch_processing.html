			Batch processing allows multiple operation requests to be grouped in a sequence and executed together as a unit. If any of the operation requests in the sequence fail, the entire group of operations is rolled back.

			Frequently-run batch commands can be stored in an external text file and can be loaded either by passing the full path to the file as an argument to the <code class="literal">batch</code> command or executed directly by being passed as an argument to the <code class="literal">run-batch</code> command.
		</p><p>
			You can create a batch command file by using a text editor and placing each command on its own line.
		</p><p>
			The following command will load the <code class="literal">myscript.txt</code> file in batch mode. The commands from this file can then be edited or removed. New commands can be inserted. Changes made in this batch session do not persist to the <code class="literal">myscript.txt</code> file.
		</p><pre class="screen">batch --file=myscript.txt</pre><p>
			The following will immediately run the batch commands stored in the file <code class="literal">myscript.txt</code>
		</p><pre class="screen">run-batch --file=myscript.txt</pre><p>
			The entered sequence of operation requests is completed as a batch.
