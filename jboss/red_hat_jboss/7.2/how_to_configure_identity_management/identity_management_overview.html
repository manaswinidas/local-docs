			The basic identity management concepts for securing applications with various identity stores are covered in the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html-single/security_architecture/"><span class="emphasis"><em>Security Architecture</em></span> guide</a>. This guide shows you how to configure various identity stores, such as a filesystem or LDAP, to secure applications. In some cases you can also use certain identity stores, such as LDAP, as an authorization authority. Various role and access information about principals can be stored in an LDAP directory which can then be used directly by JBoss EAP or mapped to existing JBoss EAP roles.

				Using identity stores backed by external datastores, such as databases or LDAP directories, can have a performance impact on authentication and authorization due to the data access and transport between the external datastore and the JBoss EAP instance.
