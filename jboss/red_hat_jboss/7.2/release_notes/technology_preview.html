				The following configurations and features are provided as Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
			</p><p>
				See <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview">Technology Preview Features Support Scope</a> on the Red Hat Customer Portal for information about the support scope for Technology Preview features.
			</p></div><h2><a id="new_agroal_datasources_subsystem"/>New Agroal Datasources Subsystem</h2><p>
			JBoss EAP 7.2 introduces the <code class="literal">datasources-agroal</code> subsystem, which is a lightweight datasource connection pool implementation that performs exceptionally well in situations with high contention on the pool. This can be used as an alternative to the current JCA-based <code class="literal">datasources</code> subsystem.
		</p><p>
			This subsystem is not enabled in the default JBoss EAP configuration. For information on enabling and using Agroal datasources, see <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html-single/configuration_guide/#datasource_management_agroal">Datasource Management With Agroal</a> in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Configuration Guide</em></span>.
		</p><h2><a id="microprofile_rest_client"/>MicroProfile REST Client</h2><p>
			JBoss EAP now supports the MicroProfile REST client that builds on JAX-RS 2.0 client APIs to provide a type-safe approach to invoke RESTful services over HTTP. With the MicroProfile REST client, you can write client applications with executable code. The MicroProfile TypeSafe REST clients, which are defined as Java interfaces, enable programmatic and declarative registration of providers.
		</p><p>
			For more information about the MicroProfile REST client, see the <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html-single/developing_web_services_applications/#microprofile_rest_client">MicroProfile Rest Client</a> section in <span class="emphasis"><em>Developing Web Services Applications</em></span> for JBoss EAP.
		</p><h2><a id="extending_resteasy_support_for_asynchronous_request_processing_and_reactive_return_types"/>Extending RESTEasy Support for Asynchronous Request Processing and Reactive Return Types</h2><p>
			JBoss EAP now extends the RESTEasy support for asynchronous request processing and reactive return types. This includes support for pluggable reactive types, and extensions for additional reactive classes. A new type of invoker named <code class="literal">RxInvoker</code>, and a default implementation of this type named <code class="literal">CompletionStageRxInvoker</code> are also supported. JBoss EAP also provides the ability to convert a filter into an asynchronous filter. Proxies, the RESTEasy extension that supports an intuitive programming, is extended to include both <code class="literal">CompletionStage</code> and the RxJava2 types <code class="literal">Single</code>, <code class="literal">Observable</code>, and <code class="literal">Flowable</code>.

			JBoss EAP 7.2 implements the <a class="link" href="http://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config/">SmallRye Config</a> component, which provides support for <a class="link" href="https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config">Eclipse MicroProfile Config</a> using the <code class="literal">microprofile-config-smallrye</code> subsystem. This allows applications and microservices to be configured to run in multiple environments without a need for modification or repackaging.

			JBoss EAP 7.2 implements the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-opentracing">SmallRye OpenTracing</a> component, which provides support for the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-opentracing.asciidoc">Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing</a> specification. This allows requests to be traced as they go through applications and services deployed to the JBoss EAP server, and extends observability of the request’s lifecycle.

			JBoss EAP 7.2 includes the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health">SmallRye Health</a> component, which provides <a class="link" href="https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health">Eclipse MicroProfile Health</a> functionality. This feature allows you to check on the health of a remote node and determine if the JBoss EAP instance is responding as expected. The <code class="literal">microprofile-health-smallrye</code> subsystem is included in the default JBoss EAP 7.2 configuration.
