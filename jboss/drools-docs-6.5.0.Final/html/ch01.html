    deployment. The mechanism used by Drools and jBPM was very flexible, but it was too flexible.
    A big focus for 6.0 was streamlining the build, deploy and loading(utilization) aspects of the
    system. Building and deploying now align with Maven and the utilization is now convention and
    configuration oriented, instead of programmatic, with sane default to minimise the
    configuration.</p><p>The workbench has been rebuilt from the ground up, inspired by Eclipse, to provide a
    flexible and better integrated solution; with panels and perspectives via plugins. The base
    workbench has been spun off into a standalone project called UberFire, so that anyone now can
    build high quality web based workbenches. In the longer term it will facilitate user
    customised Drools and jBPM installations.</p><p>Git replaces JCR as the content repository, offering a fast and scalable back-end storage
    for content that has strong tooling support. There has been a refocus on simplicity away from
    databases with an aim of storing everything as text file, even meta data is just a file.
    The database is just there to provide fast indexing and search via Lucene. This will allow
    repositories now to be synced and published with established infrastructure, like
    GitHub.</p><p>jBPM has been dramatically beefed up, thanks to the Polymita acquisition, with human
    tasks, form builders, class modellers, execution servers and runtime management. All fully
    integrated into the new workbench.</p><p>OptaPlanner is now a top level project and getting full time attention.</p><p>A new umbrella name, KIE (Knowledge Is Everything), has been introduced to bring our related technologies
      together under one roof. It also acts as the core shared around for our projects. So expect to see it a
      lot.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.2. Getting Involved"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="gettingstarted"/>1.2. Getting Involved</h2></div></div></div><p>We are often asked "How do I get involved". Luckily the answer is
  simple, just write some code and submit it :) There are no hoops you have to
  jump through or secret handshakes. We have a very minimal "overhead" that we
  do request to allow for scalable project development. Below we provide a
  general overview of the tools and "workflow" we request, along with some
  general advice.</p><p>If you contribute some good work, don't forget to blog about it

    to use JIRA, the issue tracker. This ensures that all requests are logged
    and allocated to a release schedule and all discussions captured in one
    place. Bug reports, bug fixes, feature requests and feature submissions
    should all go here. General questions should be undertaken at the mailing
    lists.</p><p>Minor code submissions, like format or documentation fixes do not
    need an associated JIRA issue created.</p><p><a class="link" href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBRULES">https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBRULES

    JIRA you should now be ready to code :) Create a GitHub account and fork
    any of the Drools, jBPM or Guvnor repositories. The fork will create a copy
    in your own GitHub space which you can work on at your own pace. If you
    make a mistake, don't worry blow it away and fork again. Note each GitHub
    repository provides you the clone (checkout) URL, GitHub will provide you
    URLs specific to your fork.</p><p><a class="link" href="https://github.com/droolsjbpm">https://github.com/droolsjbpm</a></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/GettingInvolved/fork_github.png"/></div></div><div class="section" title="1.2.5. Writing Tests"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e109"/>1.2.5. Writing Tests</h3></div></div></div><p>When writing tests, try and keep them minimal and self contained. We
    prefer to keep the DRL fragments within the test, as it makes for quicker
    reviewing. If their are a large number of rules then using a String is not
    practical so then by all means place them in separate DRL files instead to
    be loaded from the classpath. If your tests need to use a model, please
    try to use those that already exist for other unit tests; such as Person,
    Cheese or Order. If no classes exist that have the fields you need, try
    and update fields of existing classes before adding a new class.</p><p>There are a vast number of tests to look over to get an idea,
    MiscTest is a good place to start.</p><p><a class="link" href="https://github.com/droolsjbpm">https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools/blob/master/drools-compiler/src/test/java/org/drools/integrationtests/MiscTest.java</a></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/GettingInvolved/unit_test.png"/></div></div><div class="section" title="1.2.6. Commit with Correct Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e122"/>1.2.6. Commit with Correct Conventions</h3></div></div></div><p>When you commit, make sure you use the correct conventions. The
    commit must start with the JIRA issue id, such as JBRULES-220. This
    ensures the commits are cross referenced via JIRA, so we can see all
    commits for a given issue in the same place. After the id the title of the
    issue should come next. Then use a newline, indented with a dash, to
    provide additional information related to this commit. Use an additional
    new line and dash for each separate point you wish to make. You may add
    additional JIRA cross references to the same commit, if it's appropriate.
    In general try to avoid combining unrelated issues in the same
    commit.</p><p>Don't forget to rebase your local fork from the original master and
    then push your commits back to your fork.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/GettingInvolved/jira_crossreferenced.png"/></div></div><div class="section" title="1.2.7. Submit Pull Requests"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e132"/>1.2.7. Submit Pull Requests</h3></div></div></div><p>With your code rebased from original master and pushed to your
    personal GitHub area, you can now submit your work as a pull request. If
    you look at the top of the page in GitHub for your work area their will be
    a "Pull Request" button. Selecting this will then provide a gui to
    automate the submission of your pull request.</p><p>The pull request then goes into a queue for everyone to see and
    comment on. Below you can see a typical pull request. The pull requests
    allow for discussions and it shows all associated commits and the diffs
    for each commit. The discussions typically involve code reviews which
    provide helpful suggestions for improvements, and allows for us to leave
    inline comments on specific parts of the code. Don't be disheartened if we
    don't merge straight away, it can often take several revisions before we
    accept a pull request. Luckily GitHub makes it very trivial to go back to
    your code, do some more commits and then update your pull request to your
    latest and greatest.</p><p>It can take time for us to get round to responding to pull requests,
    so please be patient. Submitted tests that come with a fix will generally
    be applied quite quickly, where as just tests will often way until we get
    time to also submit that with a fix. Don't forget to rebase and resubmit
    your request from time to time, otherwise over time it will have merge
    conflicts and core developers will general ignore those.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/GettingInvolved/submit_pull_request.png"/></div></div></div><div class="section" title="1.3. Installation and Setup (Core and IDE)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="installationAndSetup"/>1.3. Installation and Setup (Core and IDE)</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" title="1.3.1. Installing and using"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e147"/>1.3.1. Installing and using</h3></div></div></div><p>Drools provides an Eclipse-based IDE (which is optional), but at its core only Java 1.5 (Java SE) is
  required.</p><p>A simple way to get started is to download and install the Eclipse plug-in - this will also require the Eclipse
  GEF framework to be installed (see below, if you don't have it installed already). This will provide you with all the
  dependencies you need to get going: you can simply create a new rule project and everything will be done for you.
  Refer to the chapter on the Rule Workbench and IDE for detailed instructions on this. Installing the Eclipse plug-in
  is generally as simple as unzipping a file into your Eclipse plug-in directory.</p><p>Use of the Eclipse plug-in is not required. Rule files are just textual input (or spreadsheets as the case may
  be) and the IDE (also known as the Rule Workbench) is just a convenience. People have integrated the rule engine in
  many ways, there is no "one size fits all".</p><p>Alternatively, you can download the binary distribution, and include the relevant JARs in your projects
  classpath.</p><div class="section" title="1.3.1.1. Dependencies and JARs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e158"/>1.3.1.1. Dependencies and JARs</h4></div></div></div><p>Drools is broken down into a few modules, some are required during rule development/compiling, and some are
    required at runtime. In many cases, people will simply want to include all the dependencies at runtime, and this is
    fine. It allows you to have the most flexibility. However, some may prefer to have their "runtime" stripped down to
    the bare minimum, as they will be deploying rules in binary form - this is also possible. The core runtime engine
    can be quite compact, and only requires a few 100 kilobytes across 3 JAR files.</p><p>The following is a description of the important libraries that make up JBoss Drools</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>knowledge-api.jar - this provides the interfaces and factories. It also helps clearly show what is
        intended as a user API and what is just an engine API.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>knowledge-internal-api.jar - this provides internal interfaces and factories.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>drools-core.jar - this is the core engine, runtime component. Contains both the RETE engine and the LEAPS
        engine. This is the only runtime dependency if you are pre-compiling rules (and deploying via Package or
        RuleBase objects).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>drools-compiler.jar - this contains the compiler/builder components to take rule source, and build
        executable rule bases. This is often a runtime dependency of your application, but it need not be if you are
        pre-compiling your rules. This depends on drools-core.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>drools-jsr94.jar - this is the JSR-94 compliant implementation, this is essentially a layer over the
        drools-compiler component. Note that due to the nature of the JSR-94 specification, not all features are easily
        exposed via this interface. In some cases, it will be easier to go direct to the Drools API, but in some
        environments the JSR-94 is mandated.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>drools-decisiontables.jar - this is the decision tables 'compiler' component, which uses the
        drools-compiler component. This supports both excel and CSV input formats.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are quite a few other dependencies which the above components require, most of which are for the
    drools-compiler, drools-jsr94 or drools-decisiontables module. Some key ones to note are "POI" which provides the
    spreadsheet parsing ability, and "antlr" which provides the parsing for the rule language itself.</p><p>NOTE: if you are using Drools in J2EE or servlet containers and you come across classpath issues with "JDT",
    then you can switch to the janino compiler. Set the system property "drools.compiler": For example:
    -Ddrools.compiler=JANINO.</p><p>For up to date info on dependencies in a release, consult the released POMs, which can be found on the Maven
    repository.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.3.1.2. Use with Maven, Gradle, Ivy, Buildr or Ant"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e190"/>1.3.1.2. Use with Maven, Gradle, Ivy, Buildr or Ant</h4></div></div></div><p>The JARs are also available in <a class="link" href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|org.drools">the central
    Maven repository</a> (and also in <a class="link" href="https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav~org.drools~~~~">the JBoss Maven

    KnowledgePackage objects, or KnowledgeBase objects etc). This is an optional feature that allows you to keep your
    runtime very light. You may use drools-compiler to produce rule packages "out of process", and then deploy them to a
    runtime system. This runtime system only requires drools-core.jar and knowledge-api for execution. This is an optional
    deployment pattern, and many people do not need to "trim" their application this much, but it is an ideal option for
    certain environments.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.3.1.4. Installing IDE (Rule Workbench)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e220"/>1.3.1.4. Installing IDE (Rule Workbench)</h4></div></div></div><p>The rule workbench (for Eclipse) requires that you have Eclipse 3.4 or greater, as well as Eclipse GEF 3.4 or

    a choice of other tools separate to rules. You can choose just to install rules from the "bundle" that JBoss IDE

        project-specific runtime.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Install/drools-runtimes2.png" align="middle"/></div><p>You can add as many Drools runtimes as you need. For example, the screenshot below shows a configuration
        where three runtimes have been defined: a Drools 4.0.7 runtime, a Drools 5.0.0 runtime and a Drools
        5.0.0.SNAPSHOT runtime. The Drools 5.0.0 runtime is selected as the default one.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Install/drools-runtimes3.png" align="middle"/></div><p>Note that you will need to restart Eclipse if you changed the default runtime and you want to make sure
        that all the projects that are using the default runtime update their classpath accordingly.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.3.1.4.4.2. Selecting a runtime for your Drools project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a id="d0e306"/>1.3.1.4.4.2. Selecting a runtime for your Drools project</h6></div></div></div><p>Whenever you create a Drools project (using the New Drools Project wizard or by converting an existing
        Java project to a Drools project using the "Convert to Drools Project" action that is shown when you are in the
        Drools perspective and you right-click an existing Java project), the plugin will automatically add all the
        required JARs to the classpath of your project.</p><p>When creating a new Drools project, the plugin will automatically use the default Drools runtime for that
        project, unless you specify a project-specific one. You can do this in the final step of the New Drools Project
        wizard, as shown below, by deselecting the "Use default Drools runtime" checkbox and selecting the appropriate
        runtime in the drop-down box. If you click the "Configure workspace settings ..." link, the workspace
        preferences showing the currently installed Drools runtimes will be opened, so you can add new runtimes
        there.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Install/drools-runtimes-newproject.png" align="middle"/></div><p>You can change the runtime of a Drools project at any time by opening the project properties (right-click
        the project and select Properties) and selecting the Drools category, as shown below. Check the "Enable project
        specific settings" checkbox and select the appropriate runtime from the drop-down box. If you click the
        "Configure workspace settings ..." link, the workspace preferences showing the currently installed Drools
        runtimes will be opened, so you can add new runtimes there. If you deselect the "Enable project specific
        settings" checkbox, it will use the default runtime as defined in your global preferences.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Install/drools-runtimes-project.png" align="middle"/></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="1.3.2. Building from source"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e322"/>1.3.2. Building from source</h3></div></div></div><div class="section" title="1.3.2.1. Getting the sources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e325"/>1.3.2.1. Getting the sources</h4></div></div></div><p>The source code of each Maven artifact is available in the JBoss Maven repository as a source JAR.

    recommended to get our sources from our source control.</p><p>Drools and jBPM use <a class="link" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for source control. The blessed git
